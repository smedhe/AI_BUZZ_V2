# Replicating KV Heads
## Overview
Replicating KV heads is a crucial feature in the Efficient Transformers Wiki, enabling the duplication of key-value heads in transformer models. This page provides an in-depth overview of the script for replicating KV heads and its application in the Efficient Transformers framework.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components involved in replicating KV heads include the `replicate_kv_heads.py` script, located at `scripts/replicate_kv_head/replicate_kv_heads.py`, which is responsible for replicating the KV heads, and the `__init__.py` file, located at `scripts/replicate_kv_head/__init__.py`, which initializes the replication process. Additionally, the `QEfficient` library plays a vital role in the replication process.

## How it Works
The replication process works by executing the `replicate_kv_heads.py` script, which takes the necessary inputs and parameters to replicate the KV heads. The script utilizes the `QEfficient` library to perform the replication, leveraging its quantization capabilities to optimize the process.

## Example(s)
An example of replicating KV heads can be seen in the `tests/transformers/models/test_causal_lm_models.py` file, where the `test_causal_lm_pytorch_vs_kv_vs_ort_vs_ai100` function tests the replication of KV heads for causal language modeling, demonstrating the effectiveness of the replication process.
