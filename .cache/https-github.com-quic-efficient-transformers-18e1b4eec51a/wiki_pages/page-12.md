# Visionâ€‘Language Model Inference Examples
## Overview
Vision-language models are a type of multimodal model that can process and generate text based on visual inputs, such as images. These models have a wide range of applications, including image captioning, visual question answering, and text-to-image synthesis. In this section, we will provide examples of how to use vision-language models for inference, including code snippets and explanations of the key components and concepts involved. The use of vision-language models has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many state-of-the-art models being developed and applied to various tasks.

The applications of vision-language models are diverse and continue to expand. For instance, they can be used in image captioning tasks, where the model generates a caption for a given image. They can also be used in visual question answering tasks, where the model answers questions about a given image. Additionally, vision-language models can be used in text-to-image synthesis tasks, where the model generates an image based on a given text prompt.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components of a vision-language model include:

* **Vision encoder**: This is the component of the model that processes the visual input, such as an image, and extracts features from it. The vision encoder is typically a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is pre-trained on a large dataset of images.
* **Language decoder**: This is the component of the model that generates text based on the features extracted by the vision encoder. The language decoder is typically a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a transformer model that is pre-trained on a large dataset of text.
* **Multimodal fusion**: This refers to the process of combining the features extracted by the vision encoder with the text generated by the language decoder to produce a final output. Multimodal fusion is a critical component of vision-language models, as it allows the model to integrate information from multiple sources and generate coherent and accurate outputs.

Some key concepts involved in vision-language models include:

* **Multimodal learning**: This refers to the process of learning from multiple sources of data, such as images and text. Multimodal learning is a key aspect of vision-language models, as it allows the model to learn from multiple sources of information and generate outputs that are informed by both visual and textual data.
* **Transfer learning**: This refers to the process of using a pre-trained model as a starting point for a new task, rather than training a model from scratch. Transfer learning is a common technique used in vision-language models, as it allows the model to leverage pre-trained models and fine-tune them for specific tasks.

## How it Works
The process of using a vision-language model for inference typically involves the following steps:

1. **Preprocessing**: The input image is preprocessed to extract features from it, such as resizing and normalizing the image. Preprocessing is an important step in vision-language models, as it allows the model to extract relevant features from the input image and generate accurate outputs.
2. **Vision encoding**: The preprocessed image is passed through the vision encoder to extract features from it. The vision encoder extracts features from the input image, such as objects, scenes, and actions, and represents them as a vector or tensor.
3. **Language decoding**: The features extracted by the vision encoder are passed through the language decoder to generate text. The language decoder generates text based on the features extracted by the vision encoder, such as a caption or a response to a question.
4. **Multimodal fusion**: The features extracted by the vision encoder are combined with the text generated by the language decoder to produce a final output. Multimodal fusion is a critical step in vision-language models, as it allows the model to integrate information from multiple sources and generate coherent and accurate outputs.

## Example(s)
Here is an example of how to use the InternVL model for inference:
```python
from QEfficient import QEFFAutoModelForCausalLM
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoProcessor

# Load the model and tokenizer
model = QEFFAutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("internvl-1b")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("internvl-1b")
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("internvl-1b")

# Preprocess the input image
image = Image.open("image.jpg")
image = image.resize((256, 256))

# Pass the image through the vision encoder
vision_features = model.vision_encoder(image)

# Generate text based on the vision features
text = model.generate(vision_features, max_length=100)

# Print the generated text
print(text)
```
This example demonstrates how to use the InternVL model for inference, including loading the model and tokenizer, preprocessing the input image, passing the image through the vision encoder, generating text based on the vision features, and printing the generated text.
