# System Architecture
## Overview
The QEfficient library is designed to simplify the onboarding of models inference for any Transformer architecture on Cloud AI platforms. It provides a layered architecture consisting of a base model class, transformer transforms, and a QNN compilation pipeline. This architecture enables efficient model optimization, compilation, and deployment on Cloud AI 100 hardware. The library's primary goal is to reduce the complexity associated with deploying Transformer models on cloud-based AI platforms, making it easier for developers to integrate these models into their applications.

The QEfficient library achieves this by providing a set of tools and interfaces that automate the process of model optimization, compilation, and deployment. The library's architecture is modular, allowing developers to easily extend or modify its components to suit their specific needs. The base model class, transformer transforms, and QNN compilation pipeline work together to provide a seamless and efficient workflow for deploying Transformer models on Cloud AI 100 hardware.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components of the QEfficient library include:
* **Base Model Class**: The `QEFFBaseModel` class serves as the foundation for various model classes, providing utility methods for tasks such as applying PyTorch and ONNX transformations. This class is responsible for managing the model's lifecycle, including initialization, training, and inference. The `QEFFBaseModel` class is implemented in `QEfficient/base/modeling_qeff.py`.
* **Transformer Transforms**: The `transform` function optimizes a given model for Cloud AI 100 by replacing its `torch.nn.Module` layers with optimized implementations. This process involves modifying the model's architecture to take advantage of the Cloud AI 100 hardware's capabilities, resulting in improved performance and efficiency. The `transform` function is implemented in `QEfficient/transformers/transform.py`.
* **QNN Compilation Pipeline**: The `compile` function compiles a given ONNX model using the QNN compiler and saves the compiled `qpc` package. This pipeline is responsible for converting the optimized model into a format that can be executed on Cloud AI 100 hardware. The `compile` function is implemented in `QEfficient/compile/qnn_compiler.py`.

## How it Works
The QEfficient library works by first applying PyTorch transformations to the input model, followed by ONNX transformations after exporting the model to ONNX format. The transformed model is then compiled using the QNN compiler, resulting in a compiled `qpc` package that can be deployed on Cloud AI 100 hardware.

The workflow can be broken down into the following steps:
1. **Model Initialization**: The input model is initialized and prepared for transformation.
2. **PyTorch Transformations**: The `QEFFBaseModel` class applies PyTorch transformations to the input model, optimizing its architecture for Cloud AI 100 hardware.
3. **ONNX Export**: The transformed model is exported to ONNX format, allowing for further optimization and compilation.
4. **ONNX Transformations**: The `transform` function applies ONNX transformations to the exported model, further optimizing its architecture for Cloud AI 100 hardware.
5. **QNN Compilation**: The transformed ONNX model is compiled using the QNN compiler, resulting in a compiled `qpc` package.
6. **Deployment**: The compiled `qpc` package is deployed on Cloud AI 100 hardware, allowing for efficient and optimized model inference.

## Example(s)
An example of using the QEfficient library is as follows:
```python
from QEfficient import QEFFAutoModel
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

model = QEFFAutoModel.from_pretrained("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2", pooling="mean")
model.compile(num_cores=16)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
inputs = tokenizer("My name is", return_tensors="pt")
output = model.generate(inputs)
print(output)  # Output will be a dictionary containing extracted features.
```
This example demonstrates how to use the QEfficient library to optimize and deploy a Transformer model on Cloud AI 100 hardware. The `QEFFAutoModel` class is used to initialize the model, and the `compile` method is used to compile the model for deployment.
