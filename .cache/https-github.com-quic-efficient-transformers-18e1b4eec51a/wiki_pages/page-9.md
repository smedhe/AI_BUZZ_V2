# Introduction to QEfficient
QEfficient is a library designed for efficient inference on Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 using Hugging Face Transformer models. It provides a range of tools and utilities to optimize the performance of these models on the Cloud AI 100 platform.

## Overview
The QEfficient library is built on top of the Hugging Face Transformers library and provides a simple and intuitive interface for loading and using pre-trained models. It also includes a range of features and tools to optimize the performance of these models, including quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation.

## Key Components / Concepts
The QEfficient library consists of several key components, including:
* **QEfficient Models**: These are pre-trained models that have been optimized for use on the Cloud AI 100 platform.
* **Quantization**: This is a technique used to reduce the precision of the model's weights and activations, which can significantly improve inference speed.
* **Pruning**: This is a technique used to remove unnecessary weights and connections from the model, which can also improve inference speed.

## How it Works
The QEfficient library works by providing a simple and intuitive interface for loading and using pre-trained models. The user can select a pre-trained model and configure it for use on the Cloud AI 100 platform. The library then applies a range of optimizations, including quantization and pruning, to improve the performance of the model.

## Example(s)
Here is an example of how to use the QEfficient library to load a pre-trained model and configure it for use on the Cloud AI 100 platform:
```python
from QEfficient import QEFFAutoModel

# Load a pre-trained model
model = QEFFAutoModel.from_pretrained("qeff-base-uncased")

# Configure the model for use on the Cloud AI 100 platform
model.config.cloud_ai_100 = True
```
