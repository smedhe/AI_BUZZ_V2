# Text Generation Example
## Overview
This page provides an example of text generation using transformer models, specifically focusing on the Efficient Transformers Wiki repository.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components involved in text generation are:
* Transformer models, such as those implemented in `QEfficient/generation/text_generation_inference.py`
* Tokenizers, utilized for input processing
* Input handlers, responsible for managing the input prompts

## How it Works
The text generation process works as follows:
1. The input prompt is tokenized using a tokenizer, as seen in `QEfficient/utils/run_utils.py`.
2. The tokenized input is passed to the transformer model.
3. The model generates output tokens based on the input prompt, leveraging the capabilities of transformer architectures.
4. The output tokens are decoded to form the generated text, which can be observed in the example provided in `examples/basic_gguf_models.py`.

## Example(s)
An example of text generation can be seen in the `examples/basic_gguf_models.py` file, where a GGUF model is used to generate text based on input prompts. This example demonstrates the practical application of text generation using transformer models.
