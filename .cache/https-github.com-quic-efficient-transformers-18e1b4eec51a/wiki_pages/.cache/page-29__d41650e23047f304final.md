# Perplexity Computation
## Overview
Perplexity computation is a crucial aspect of evaluating the performance of language models. It measures how well a model can predict a test set, given the model was trained on a training set.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components involved in perplexity computation include:
- **Language Model**: A statistical model that predicts the next word in a sequence, given the context of the previous words.
- **Test Set**: A dataset used to evaluate the performance of the language model.
- **Perplexity Metric**: A measure of how well the model predicts the test set.

## How it Works
The perplexity computation script works by:
1. Loading the language model and test set from files such as `models/language_model.pth` and `data/test_set.csv`.
2. Using the model to predict the next word in each sequence of the test set.
3. Calculating the perplexity metric based on the predictions using the formula implemented in `scripts/perplexity_computation/calculate_perplexity.py`.

## Example(s)
An example of perplexity computation can be seen in the `calculate_perplexity.py` script, which takes a language model and test set as input and outputs the perplexity metric. This script is located at `scripts/perplexity_computation/calculate_perplexity.py`.
