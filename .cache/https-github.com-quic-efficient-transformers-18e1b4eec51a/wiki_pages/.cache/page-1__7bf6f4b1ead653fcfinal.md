# Project Overview
## Overview
The Efficient Transformers library is a software library designed to optimize large language models (LLMs) for deployment on Qualcomm Cloud AI 100, enabling efficient inference and training. The library provides a unified interface for loading, exporting, compiling, and running various encoder-only transformer models from the HuggingFace hub on Cloud AI 100 hardware. This library is particularly useful for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and language translation, where large language models are often required.

The Efficient Transformers library is built on top of the HuggingFace Transformers library, which provides a wide range of pre-trained models for various NLP tasks. However, these models are often too large and computationally expensive to be deployed on edge devices or in resource-constrained environments. The Efficient Transformers library addresses this issue by providing a set of tools and techniques for optimizing these models for deployment on Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 hardware.

## Key Components / Concepts
The library consists of several key components, including:
* QEFFAutoModel: a class that provides a unified interface for loading, exporting, compiling, and running various encoder-only transformer models from the HuggingFace hub on Cloud AI 100 hardware. This class is the main entry point for using the Efficient Transformers library and provides a simple and intuitive API for working with optimized models.
* QEFFTransformersBase: a base class for QEfficient wrappers around HuggingFace transformer models, providing common functionality for loading, representing, and managing HuggingFace models within the QEfficient framework. This class provides a set of common methods and attributes that can be used to work with optimized models, such as loading and saving models, and accessing model parameters.
* from_pretrained: a function that loads a QEfficient transformer model from a pretrained HuggingFace model or local path, initializing it with the pretrained weights. This function is used to load pre-trained models from the HuggingFace hub or from local files, and to initialize the model with the pre-trained weights.

In addition to these key components, the library also provides a set of utility functions and classes for working with optimized models, such as model compilation, graph transformations, and patcher modules. These utility functions and classes provide a set of tools and techniques for optimizing models for deployment on Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 hardware, and for working with optimized models in a variety of contexts.

## How it Works
The library works by taking a model card from HuggingFace or a local model path as input and outputting an optimized model implementation for Cloud AI 100. The library provides reimplemented transformer blocks, graph transformations, and patcher modules to ensure efficient execution and handle precision issues.

The optimization process involves several steps, including:
1. Model loading: The library loads the pre-trained model from the HuggingFace hub or from a local file.
2. Model analysis: The library analyzes the model architecture and identifies opportunities for optimization.
3. Model transformation: The library applies a set of transformations to the model, such as quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation, to reduce the model's computational complexity and memory footprint.
4. Model compilation: The library compiles the optimized model into a format that can be executed on Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 hardware.
5. Model deployment: The library deploys the optimized model on Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 hardware, where it can be used for inference and training.

The library also provides a set of tools and techniques for working with optimized models, such as model evaluation, model fine-tuning, and model deployment. These tools and techniques provide a set of methods and APIs for working with optimized models in a variety of contexts, and for deploying optimized models in production environments.

## Example(s)
An example of using the QEFFAutoModel class is as follows:
```python
from QEfficient import QEFFAutoModel
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

model = QEFFAutoModel.from_pretrained("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2", pooling="mean")
model.compile(num_cores=16)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
inputs = tokenizer("My name is", return_tensors="pt")
output = model.generate(inputs)
print(output)  # Output will be a dictionary containing extracted features.
```
This example demonstrates how to use the QEFFAutoModel class to load a pre-trained model, compile it for execution on Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 hardware, and use it for inference.

In addition to this example, the library also provides a set of other examples and tutorials that demonstrate how to use the library in a variety of contexts. These examples and tutorials provide a set of code snippets and APIs that can be used to work with optimized models, and to deploy optimized models in production environments.
