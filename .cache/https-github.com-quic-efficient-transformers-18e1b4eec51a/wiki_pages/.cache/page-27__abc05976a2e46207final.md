# Installation Guide
## Overview
The Efficient Transformers library provides support for various transformer models, including Llama4, Gemma3, and HP-CAI Grok-1, among others. This guide will walk you through the installation process of the library, which is located in the `efficient-transformers` directory.

## Key Components / Concepts
The library has several key components, including:
* `QEFFAutoModel`: a class designed for manipulating any transformer model from the HuggingFace hub, as defined in `QEfficient/transformers/models/modeling_auto.py`.
* `QEFFTransformersBase`: a parent class for models provided by QEFF, which are based on transformers from the `transformers/models/modeling_auto.py` file.
* `transform`: a function that optimizes a model for Cloud AI 100 by replacing its torch.nn.Module layers with optimized implementations, as demonstrated in `tests/transformers/test_transformer_pytorch_transforms.py`.

## How it Works
The installation process involves several steps:
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/quic/efficient-transformers.git` and navigate to the `efficient-transformers` directory.
2. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`, as specified in `pyproject.toml`.
3. Create a virtual environment using `python3.10 -m venv myenv`, as outlined in the `Dockerfile`.

## Example(s)
To install the library, follow these steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/quic/efficient-transformers.git
cd efficient-transformers
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3.10 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```
