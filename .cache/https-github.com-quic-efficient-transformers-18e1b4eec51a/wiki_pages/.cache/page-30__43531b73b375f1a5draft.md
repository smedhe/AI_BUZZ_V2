# Replicating KV Heads
## Overview
Replicating KV heads is a crucial feature in the Efficient Transformers Wiki. This page provides an overview of the script for replicating KV heads and its application.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components involved in replicating KV heads include the `replicate_kv_heads.py` script, which is responsible for replicating the KV heads, and the `__init__.py` file, which initializes the replication process.

## How it Works
The replication process works by executing the `replicate_kv_heads.py` script, which takes the necessary inputs and parameters to replicate the KV heads. The script uses the `QEfficient` library to perform the replication.

## Example(s)
An example of replicating KV heads can be seen in the `tests/transformers/models/test_causal_lm_models.py` file, where the `test_causal_lm_pytorch_vs_kv_vs_ort_vs_ai100` function tests the replication of KV heads for causal language modeling.
