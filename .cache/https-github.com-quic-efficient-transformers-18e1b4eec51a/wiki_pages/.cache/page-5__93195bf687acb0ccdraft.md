# Installation and Setup Guide
## Overview
The QEfficient library is designed to work with the Cloud AI 100 Apps SDK, providing efficient transformers for various tasks. To get started, it's essential to install the required dependencies and set up the environment correctly. This guide will walk you through the step-by-step process of installing the library, building optional components, and configuring the runtime.

## Key Components / Concepts
Before diving into the installation process, it's crucial to understand the key components involved:
* Cloud AI 100 Apps SDK: This is the primary dependency required for QEfficient to function.
* Efficient-Transformers: This library provides optimized transformer models for various tasks.
* Python virtual environment: This is used to isolate the dependencies and ensure a clean installation.

## How it Works
The installation process involves the following steps:
1. Download and install the Cloud AI 100 Apps SDK.
2. Uninstall any existing versions of the Apps SDK.
3. Install Efficient-Transformers using a Python virtual environment.
4. Activate the virtual environment to ensure the dependencies are correctly configured.

## Example(s)
To illustrate the installation process, let's consider an example:
```bash
# Download and install the Cloud AI 100 Apps SDK
sudo ./install.sh --enable-qeff

# Activate the virtual environment
source /opt/qti-aic/dev/python/qeff/bin/activate
```
