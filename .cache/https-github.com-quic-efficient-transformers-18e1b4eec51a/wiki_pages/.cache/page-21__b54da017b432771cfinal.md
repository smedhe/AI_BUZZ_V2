# QEfficientGPT2 Notebook
## Overview
The QEfficientGPT2 notebook provides an in-depth exploration of the QEfficientGPT2 model, including its architecture, key components, and applications. Located in the `notebooks` directory, this notebook serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding the capabilities and potential use cases of the QEfficientGPT2 model.

## Key Components / Concepts
The QEfficientGPT2 model is built on top of the Hugging Face Transformers library and utilizes the PyTorch framework. The model's design prioritizes efficiency and scalability, achieved through techniques such as quantization, knowledge distillation, and pruning. These components are crucial for the model's performance and are implemented in files like `QEfficient/peft/__init__.py` and `QEfficient/utils/run_utils.py`.

## How it Works
The QEfficientGPT2 model operates by leveraging a combination of quantization, knowledge distillation, and pruning to reduce computational requirements while maintaining its performance. This process is facilitated by the PyTorch framework and the Hugging Face Transformers library, as seen in `tests/transformers/models/test_causal_lm_models.py`. The model's efficiency makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from text generation to language translation.
