# Finetuning Data Utilities
## Overview
Finetuning data utilities are essential components in the process of fine-tuning models, particularly in the context of semantic search and natural language processing tasks. These utilities are designed to prepare and manage datasets, ensuring they are properly formatted and optimized for training and inference. The QEfficient repository provides a range of finetuning data utilities, each serving a specific purpose in the dataset preparation and fine-tuning workflow.

## Key Components / Concepts
Several key components and concepts are integral to the finetuning data utilities:
- **Dataset Configuration**: This involves specifying the details of the dataset to be used for fine-tuning, such as the dataset name, preprocessing steps, and any custom configurations.
- **Data Collators**: These are functions that aggregate and prepare batches of data for training. Custom data collators can be defined based on specific dataset requirements.
- **Device-Aware Data Loading**: This feature ensures that data is loaded and processed efficiently on the target hardware, whether it be GPUs, CPUs, or specialized AI accelerators like the Qualcomm AI 100.
- **Preprocessing Functions**: Various functions are available for preprocessing datasets, including tokenization, padding, and masking, which are crucial for preparing text data for model training.

## How it Works
The finetuning data utilities work by first configuring the dataset according to the specified requirements. This can involve loading the dataset, applying preprocessing steps, and potentially filtering or augmenting the data. Once the dataset is prepared, custom data collators can be applied to aggregate the data into batches suitable for training. The utilities also handle device-aware data loading, ensuring that the data is efficiently loaded onto the target device for training or inference.

## Example(s)
An example of using these utilities involves fine-tuning a model on a custom dataset. First, the dataset needs to be configured using the `generate_dataset_config` function, specifying the dataset name and any custom preprocessing steps. Then, a custom data collator can be defined using the `get_custom_data_collator` function to aggregate the data into batches. Finally, the preprocessed dataset can be loaded onto the target device for fine-tuning.
