# Finetuning Data Utilities
## Overview
Finetuning data utilities are essential components in the process of fine-tuning models, particularly in the context of semantic search and natural language processing tasks. These utilities are designed to prepare and manage datasets, ensuring they are properly formatted and optimized for training and inference. The QEfficient repository provides a range of finetuning data utilities, each serving a specific purpose in the dataset preparation and fine-tuning workflow. The primary goal of these utilities is to streamline the process of fine-tuning models on custom datasets, making it easier to adapt pre-trained models to specific tasks or domains.

The importance of finetuning data utilities cannot be overstated, as they play a critical role in determining the performance of the fine-tuned model. By providing a standardized and efficient way to prepare and manage datasets, these utilities help to reduce the complexity and variability associated with fine-tuning models. This, in turn, enables developers to focus on higher-level tasks, such as model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## Key Components / Concepts
Several key components and concepts are integral to the finetuning data utilities:
- **Dataset Configuration**: This involves specifying the details of the dataset to be used for fine-tuning, such as the dataset name, preprocessing steps, and any custom configurations. The dataset configuration is typically defined using a configuration file or a set of command-line arguments.
- **Data Collators**: These are functions that aggregate and prepare batches of data for training. Custom data collators can be defined based on specific dataset requirements, such as padding, masking, or tokenization. Data collators play a crucial role in ensuring that the data is properly formatted and batched for training.
- **Device-Aware Data Loading**: This feature ensures that data is loaded and processed efficiently on the target hardware, whether it be GPUs, CPUs, or specialized AI accelerators like the Qualcomm AI 100. Device-aware data loading is critical for optimizing the performance of the fine-tuning process, as it enables the utilities to take advantage of the target hardware's capabilities.
- **Preprocessing Functions**: Various functions are available for preprocessing datasets, including tokenization, padding, and masking, which are crucial for preparing text data for model training. Preprocessing functions can be applied to the dataset as a whole or to individual samples, depending on the specific requirements of the task.

In addition to these key components, the finetuning data utilities also provide a range of other features and functionalities, such as data augmentation, filtering, and sampling. These features enable developers to customize the dataset preparation and fine-tuning workflow to suit their specific needs and requirements.

## How it Works
The finetuning data utilities work by first configuring the dataset according to the specified requirements. This can involve loading the dataset, applying preprocessing steps, and potentially filtering or augmenting the data. Once the dataset is prepared, custom data collators can be applied to aggregate the data into batches suitable for training. The utilities also handle device-aware data loading, ensuring that the data is efficiently loaded onto the target device for training or inference.

The workflow of the finetuning data utilities can be broken down into several key stages:
1. **Dataset Loading**: The dataset is loaded from a file or database, and the dataset configuration is applied.
2. **Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed using the specified preprocessing functions, such as tokenization, padding, and masking.
3. **Data Collation**: The preprocessed dataset is aggregated into batches using a custom data collator.
4. **Device-Aware Data Loading**: The batched dataset is loaded onto the target device for training or inference.
5. **Model Fine-Tuning**: The fine-tuned model is trained on the batched dataset, using the specified hyperparameters and training protocol.

## Example(s)
An example of using these utilities involves fine-tuning a model on a custom dataset. First, the dataset needs to be configured using the `generate_dataset_config` function, specifying the dataset name and any custom preprocessing steps. Then, a custom data collator can be defined using the `get_custom_data_collator` function to aggregate the data into batches. Finally, the preprocessed dataset can be loaded onto the target device for fine-tuning.

For instance, suppose we want to fine-tune a pre-trained language model on a custom dataset of text samples. We can use the `generate_dataset_config` function to specify the dataset name, preprocessing steps, and custom configurations. We can then define a custom data collator using the `get_custom_data_collator` function to aggregate the text samples into batches. Finally, we can use the `device_aware_data_loading` function to load the batched dataset onto the target device for fine-tuning.

```python
# Generate dataset configuration
dataset_config = generate_dataset_config(
    dataset_name="custom_dataset",
    preprocessing_steps=["tokenization", "padding"],
    custom_config={"batch_size": 32}
)

# Define custom data collator
custom_data_collator = get_custom_data_collator(
    dataset_config,
    batch_size=32,
    padding=True
)

# Load preprocessed dataset onto target device
device_aware_data_loading(
    dataset_config,
    custom_data_collator,
    target_device="gpu"
)
```
