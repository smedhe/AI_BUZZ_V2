# QEfficientMPT Notebook
## Overview
The QEfficientMPT Notebook is a comprehensive demonstration of efficient inference for the MPT model family, including weight patching and precision lowering. This notebook showcases the capabilities of the QEfficient library in optimizing transformer models for deployment on Cloud AI 100 hardware.

## Key Components / Concepts
The QEfficientMPT Notebook utilizes several key components and concepts, including:

* **QEfficient Library**: A library designed to optimize transformer models for efficient inference on Cloud AI 100 hardware.
* **MPT Model Family**: A family of transformer models optimized for semantic search and other natural language processing tasks.
* **Weight Patching**: A technique used to optimize model weights for efficient inference.
* **Precision Lowering**: A technique used to reduce the precision of model weights and activations, resulting in improved inference performance.

## How it Works
The QEfficientMPT Notebook works by:

1. Loading a pretrained MPT model using the QEfficient library.
2. Applying weight patching and precision lowering techniques to optimize the model for efficient inference.
3. Compiling the optimized model for deployment on Cloud AI 100 hardware.
4. Executing the compiled model to demonstrate its performance and efficiency.

## Example(s)
The QEfficientMPT Notebook provides an example of how to optimize an MPT model for efficient inference on Cloud AI 100 hardware. The notebook demonstrates the application of weight patching and precision lowering techniques, as well as the compilation and execution of the optimized model.
