# QEfficient Examples and Notebooks
## Overview
QEfficient is a library designed to provide efficient and scalable solutions for various NLP tasks. It offers a range of features, including model integration, deployment, and inference.

## Key Components / Concepts
QEfficient is built on top of the Hugging Face Transformers library and provides a set of classes and functions for working with transformer models. Some key components include:

*   `QEFFAutoModel`: A class for manipulating any transformer model from the Hugging Face hub.
*   `QEFFAutoModelForCausalLM`: A class for working with causal language models from the Hugging Face hub.
*   `QEFFAutoModelForImageTextToText`: A class for working with multimodal language models from the Hugging Face hub.

## How it Works
QEfficient uses a modular architecture to provide efficient and scalable solutions for various NLP tasks. The library is built on top of the Hugging Face Transformers library and provides a set of classes and functions for working with transformer models.

## Example(s)
Here is an example of how to use the `QEFFAutoModel` class to load a pre-trained model and generate text:
```python
from QEfficient import QEFFAutoModel
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

# Load the pre-trained model
model = QEFFAutoModel.from_pretrained("model_name")

# Prepare the input
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("model_name")
inputs = tokenizer("My name is", return_tensors="pt")

# Generate text
model.generate(inputs)
```
