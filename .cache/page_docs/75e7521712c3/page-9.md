# Introduction to QEfficient
## Overview
QEfficient is a library designed to optimize and enhance the performance of transformer models, providing tools and techniques such as quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation to improve efficiency and accuracy.

## Key Components / Concepts
The QEfficient library consists of several key components, including:
* **QEFFBaseModel**: a base class for all model classes, providing utility methods for child classes, defined in `QEfficient/base/modeling_qeff.py`.
* **QEFFAutoModel**: a class for automatic model selection and creation, utilizing `QEfficient/base/__init__.py` for initialization.
* **Quantization**: a technique for reducing the precision of model weights and activations to improve computational efficiency, implemented in `QEfficient/utils/__init__.py`.
* **Pruning**: a technique for removing redundant or unnecessary model weights and connections to improve computational efficiency.

## How it Works
The QEfficient library works by providing a range of tools and techniques for optimizing and enhancing transformer models, which can be applied to existing models to improve their performance and efficiency.

## Example(s)
For example, the QEfficient library can be used to optimize a transformer model for deployment on a cloud AI platform, as demonstrated in `notebooks/QEfficientMPT.ipynb`. This can involve applying quantization and pruning techniques to reduce the model's computational requirements and improve its performance.
