# JavaScript Example
## Overview
The JavaScript example provided in the Flask repository demonstrates how to create a simple web application using Flask and JavaScript. This example is located in the `examples/javascript/js_example` directory.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components of this example include:
* A Flask application instance defined in `examples/javascript/js_example/app.py`
* JavaScript code to handle client-side logic in `examples/javascript/js_example/static/js/script.js`
* HTML templates to render the user interface in `examples/javascript/js_example/templates/index.html`

## How it Works
The example works by creating a Flask application instance and defining routes for the application in `examples/javascript/js_example/routes.py`. The JavaScript code is used to handle client-side logic, such as responding to user input and updating the user interface. The HTML templates are used to render the user interface.

## Example(s)
An example of how to use JavaScript with Flask can be seen in the `examples/javascript/js_example` directory. The `app.py` file creates a Flask application instance, while the `static/js/script.js` file contains the JavaScript code.
