# Tutorial Example
## Overview
The tutorial example provided in the Flask repository is a simple web application that demonstrates the basic features of the framework. It includes a "Hello, World!" example and instructions for running it, located in the `examples/tutorial` directory.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components of the tutorial example include:
* Creating a Flask application instance in `app.py`
* Defining routes for the application using the `@app.route()` decorator
* Running the application using the `flask run` command

## How it Works
The tutorial example works by creating a Flask application instance and defining a route for the root URL ("/"). When the application is run, it listens for incoming requests and responds with the string "Hello, World!", as shown in the `examples/tutorial/flaskr/__init__.py` file.

## Example(s)
An example of the tutorial code is provided in the `examples/tutorial/flaskr/__init__.py` file:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

    User->>Browser: Request to access the application
    Browser->>Flask: Send HTTP request to the application
    Flask->>Flask: Process the request and generate a response
    Flask->>Browser: Send the response back to the browser
    Browser->>User: Display the response to the user
```
