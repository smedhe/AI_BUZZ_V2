# Request and Response Objects
## Overview
Flask provides a request object to handle HTTP requests and a response object to handle HTTP responses. These objects are crucial in building web applications as they enable the interaction between the client and the server. The request object contains information about the HTTP request, such as the method, headers, and data, while the response object contains the data to be sent back to the client.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components of the request and response objects in Flask are:
- `flask.request`: This object contains information about the current HTTP request.
- `flask.Response`: This object represents the HTTP response to be sent back to the client.
- `flask.jsonify`: This function generates a response with a JSON payload.

## How it Works
When a client sends an HTTP request to the server, Flask creates a request object that contains information about the request. The developer can then access this information using the `flask.request` object. After processing the request, the developer creates a response object using the `flask.Response` class or the `flask.jsonify` function. The response object is then sent back to the client.

## Example(s)
Here is an example of how to use the request and response objects in Flask:
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/example', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def example():
    if request.method == 'GET':
        # Handle GET request
        return jsonify({'message': 'This is a GET request'})
    elif request.method == 'POST':
        # Handle POST request
        data = request.get_json()
        return jsonify({'message': 'This is a POST request', 'data': data})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```
In this example, the `example` function handles both GET and POST requests. It uses the `flask.request` object to determine the request method and the `flask.jsonify` function to create a response with a JSON payload.

```
This flowchart shows the interaction between the client and the Flask server. The client sends an HTTP request to the server, which creates a request object and processes the request. The server then creates a response object and sends it back to the client.
