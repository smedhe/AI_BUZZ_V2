# JavaScript Example
## Overview
The JavaScript example provided in the Flask repository demonstrates how to create a simple web application using Flask and JavaScript.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components of this example include:
* A Flask application instance
* JavaScript code to handle client-side logic
* HTML templates to render the user interface

## How it Works
The example works by creating a Flask application instance and defining routes for the application. The JavaScript code is used to handle client-side logic, such as responding to user input and updating the user interface. The HTML templates are used to render the user interface.

## Example(s)
An example of how to use JavaScript with Flask can be seen in the `examples/javascript/js_example` directory.
