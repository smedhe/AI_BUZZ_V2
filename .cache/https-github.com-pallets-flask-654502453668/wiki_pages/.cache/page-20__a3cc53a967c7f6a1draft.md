# Deploying Flask Applications
## Overview
Flask applications can be deployed using various WSGI servers and deployment tools. This allows developers to choose the best approach for their specific use case.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components involved in deploying Flask applications include:
- WSGI servers such as Gunicorn or uWSGI
- Deployment tools like Docker or Kubernetes

## How it Works
To deploy a Flask application, you first need to create a WSGI entry point. This is typically done by creating an instance of the Flask class and defining routes for your application.

## Example(s)
Here's an example of creating a simple Flask application:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

This diagram shows the basic flow of a Flask application being deployed using a WSGI server and a web server.
