# Routing and URL Building
## Overview
Flask provides a flexible routing system and a URL builder to handle URLs. The routing system allows developers to map URLs to specific application endpoints, while the URL builder enables the construction of URLs for these endpoints. This section will delve into the details of how routing and URL building work in Flask, including the key components, how they work, and examples of their usage.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components involved in routing and URL building in Flask include:
- **Routes**: These are the mappings between URLs and application endpoints. Routes are defined using the `@app.route()` decorator, where `app` is an instance of the Flask application.
- **Endpoints**: These are the functions that handle requests to specific URLs. Endpoints are defined as functions within the application, and they are associated with routes using the `@app.route()` decorator.
- **URL Builders**: These are functions that construct URLs for application endpoints. The most commonly used URL builder in Flask is `flask.url_for()`, which generates URLs based on endpoint names and other parameters.

## How it Works
When a request is made to a Flask application, the routing system determines which endpoint should handle the request based on the URL. The endpoint then processes the request and returns a response. The URL builder is used to construct URLs for endpoints, which can be used in templates, redirects, and other parts of the application.

The `flask.url_for()` function is used to build URLs for endpoints. It takes the endpoint name and any required parameters as arguments, and returns a URL that can be used to access the endpoint. The `flask.url_for()` function can also be used to build external URLs, which include the scheme and hostname of the application.

## Example(s)
Here is an example of how to define a route and an endpoint in Flask:
```python
from flask import Flask, url_for

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello, World!'

@app.route('/hello/<name>')
def hello(name):
    return 'Hello, %s!' % name

# Build a URL for the index endpoint
index_url = url_for('index')

# Build a URL for the hello endpoint with a name parameter
hello_url = url_for('hello', name='John')
```
In this example, the `index` and `hello` functions are endpoints that handle requests to the `/` and `/hello/<name>` URLs, respectively. The `url_for()` function is used to build URLs for these endpoints.
