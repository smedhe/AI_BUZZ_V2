# Example Application
## Overview
The example application is a simple Flask web application that demonstrates the basic structure and functionality of a Flask app. It consists of a single route that returns a "Hello World!" message when accessed.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components of the example application are:
* The Flask application instance, created using the `Flask` class
* The route, defined using the `@app.route` decorator
* The view function, which returns the response to the client

## How it Works
Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the example application works:
1. The client sends an HTTP request to the server.
2. The server receives the request and passes it to the Flask application instance.
3. The Flask application instance uses the `@app.route` decorator to determine which view function to call.
4. The view function returns a response to the client.
5. The server sends the response back to the client.

## Example(s)
Here's an example of a simple Flask application:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"
```
This application defines a single route at the root URL ("/") and returns a "Hello World!" message when accessed.
