# Flask Tutorial
## Overview
Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework that enables developers to quickly create and scale web applications. It provides a flexible and modular structure, allowing developers to choose their own dependencies and project layout.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components of a Flask application include the application instance, routes, and templates. The application instance is created using the `Flask` class, and routes are defined using the `@app.route` decorator.

## How it Works
A Flask application works by defining routes that map to specific functions. When a request is made to the application, the route is matched and the corresponding function is called.

## Example(s)
Here is an example of a simple Flask application:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

## Diagram(s)
```mermaid

    participant Client as "Client"
    participant Server as "Server"
    participant Flask as "Flask"
    
    Client->>Server: Request
    Server->>Flask: Receive Request
    Flask->>Server: Process Request
    Server->>Client: Response
```
This diagram shows the basic flow of a request in a Flask application.
