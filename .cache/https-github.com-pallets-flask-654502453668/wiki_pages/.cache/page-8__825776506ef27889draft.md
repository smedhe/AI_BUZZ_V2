# Session Management
## Overview
Session management is a critical component of web applications, allowing them to store and retrieve data specific to each user's session. In Flask, session management is handled through the use of a session interface, which provides a way to store and retrieve session data. This page will provide an overview of the session management system used in Flask, including how to use sessions and how to customize the session interface.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components of the session management system in Flask include:

* **Session Interface**: The session interface is responsible for storing and retrieving session data. Flask provides a default session interface, but it can be customized to use a different interface.
* **Session Object**: The session object is a dictionary-like object that stores the session data. It is created by the session interface and is used to store and retrieve session data.
* **Session Key**: The session key is a unique key that is used to identify the session. It is stored in a cookie on the client's browser and is used to retrieve the session data.

## How it Works
Here is a high-level overview of how the session management system works in Flask:

1. When a user makes a request to the application, the session interface is used to retrieve the session data from the session store.
2. If the session data is not found in the session store, a new session object is created and stored in the session store.
3. The session object is then used to store and retrieve session data.
4. When the user makes a subsequent request to the application, the session interface is used to retrieve the session data from the session store.
5. The session data is then used to populate the session object, which is used to store and retrieve session data.

## Example(s)
Here is an example of how to use sessions in Flask:
```python
from flask import Flask, session

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'secret_key'

@app.route('/')
def index():
    session['testing'] = 42
    return 'Hello World'

@app.route('/get_session')
def get_session():
    return str(session)
```
In this example, the `index` function sets a session variable `testing` to the value `42`. The `get_session` function retrieves the session data and returns it as a string.

    Client->>Server: Request
    Server->>SessionInterface: Get Session
    SessionInterface->>SessionStore: Get Session Data
    SessionStore->>SessionInterface: Return Session Data
    SessionInterface->>Server: Return Session Object
    Server->>Client: Response
```
This diagram shows the flow of data between the client, server, session interface, and session store.
