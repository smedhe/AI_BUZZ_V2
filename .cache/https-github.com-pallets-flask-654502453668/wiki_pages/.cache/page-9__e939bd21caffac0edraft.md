# Example Applications Overview
## Overview
The Flask framework comes with several example applications that demonstrate its capabilities and provide a starting point for building web applications. These examples cover a range of topics, including a tutorial blog, a Celery background-task demo, and a JavaScript AJAX demo. In this section, we will provide an overview of these example applications, their key components, and how they work.

## Key Components / Concepts
The example applications are designed to showcase various aspects of the Flask framework, including routing, templating, and database interactions. The tutorial blog example demonstrates how to create a basic blog application with user authentication and posting capabilities. The Celery background-task demo shows how to use Celery to run tasks in the background, while the JavaScript AJAX demo illustrates how to use JavaScript to make AJAX requests to a Flask application.

## How it Works
Each example application is a self-contained Flask application that can be run independently. The tutorial blog example uses a SQLite database to store posts and user information, while the Celery background-task demo uses a Redis database to store task results. The JavaScript AJAX demo uses a simple in-memory database to store data.

The example applications are structured as follows:
- The tutorial blog example is located in the `examples/tutorial/flaskr` directory and consists of several files, including `__init__.py`, `models.py`, `views.py`, and `templates/index.html`.
- The Celery background-task demo is located in the `examples/celery/src/task_app` directory and consists of several files, including `__init__.py`, `tasks.py`, and `app.py`.
- The JavaScript AJAX demo is located in the `examples/javascript/js_example` directory and consists of several files, including `views.py`, `templates/index.html`, and `static/js/script.js`.

## Example(s)
To run the tutorial blog example, navigate to the `examples/tutorial/flaskr` directory and run `flask run`. This will start the development server, and you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

To run the Celery background-task demo, navigate to the `examples/celery/src/task_app` directory and run `celery -A task_app.celery worker`. This will start the Celery worker, and you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

To run the JavaScript AJAX demo, navigate to the `examples/javascript/js_example` directory and run `flask run`. This will start the development server, and you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

This flowchart illustrates the basic interaction between the client, server, and database in a Flask application.
