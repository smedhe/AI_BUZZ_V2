# Documentation Build Setup
## Overview
The documentation build setup for the Flask project is a complex process that involves multiple tools and configuration files. At the heart of this process is the `.readthedocs.yaml` file, which defines the build process for the documentation, including the operating system, Python version, and commands to install and run the necessary tools. This file is crucial in ensuring that the documentation is built consistently and correctly, regardless of the environment in which it is being built. The configuration specified in this file dictates the use of `uv` and `Sphinx` to build the documentation, with the output being generated in a specified directory. Understanding the role of each component in the build process is essential for maintaining and updating the documentation.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components of the documentation build setup include:
* `.readthedocs.yaml`: The configuration file for Read the Docs, defining the build process for the documentation. This file is written in YAML and contains detailed instructions on how to build the documentation, including the version of Python to use and the dependencies to install.
* `uv`: A tool used to manage dependencies and run commands during the build process. `uv` is utilized to install the necessary dependencies, including `Sphinx`, and to run the commands that generate the documentation.
* `Sphinx`: A documentation generator used to build the HTML documentation files. Sphinx is a powerful tool that can generate documentation in various formats, including HTML, PDF, and LaTeX.
* `README.md`: The main README file for the project, which is used as the entry point for the documentation. This file provides an overview of the project and contains links to other documentation files.
* `docs/`: The directory containing the documentation source files. This directory includes files written in reStructuredText format, which are used by Sphinx to generate the HTML documentation.
* `tests/`: The directory containing the test files for the project. These tests are used to ensure that the project's code is working correctly and can be used to test the documentation examples.

## How it Works
The documentation build process works as follows:
1. The `.readthedocs.yaml` file is read and parsed to determine the build configuration. This file is used to specify the version of Python to use, the dependencies to install, and the commands to run during the build process.
2. The `uv` tool is used to install the necessary dependencies, including `Sphinx`. `uv` is a versatile tool that can manage dependencies and run commands, making it an essential part of the build process.
3. The `Sphinx` documentation generator is run to build the HTML documentation files. Sphinx uses the documentation source files in the `docs/` directory to generate the HTML files, which are then output to a specified directory.
4. The output is generated in the specified directory, which is defined in the `.readthedocs.yaml` file. This directory contains the HTML documentation files, which can be viewed in a web browser.
5. The `README.md` file is used as the entry point for the documentation, providing an overview of the project and containing links to other documentation files.

## Example(s)
An example of the `.readthedocs.yaml` file is shown below:
```yml
version: 2
build:
  os: ubuntu-24.04
  tools:
    python: '3.13'
  commands:
    - asdf plugin add uv
    - asdf install uv latest
    - asdf global uv latest
    - uv run --group docs sphinx-build -W -b dirhtml docs $READTHEDOCS_OUTPUT/html
```
This example shows the configuration for building the documentation using `uv` and `Sphinx`. The `version` field specifies the version of the build configuration, while the `build` field defines the build process. The `os` field specifies the operating system to use, and the `tools` field defines the tools to install, including Python. The `commands` field lists the commands to run during the build process, including installing `uv` and running Sphinx.

Another example is the `docs/quickstart.rst` file, which provides a quick start guide for the project:
```rst
Welcome to Flask
================

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

Installation
------------

To install Flask, you can use pip:
```
pip install flask
```
This will install the Flask package and its dependencies.
