## Overview
Flask is a lightweight web application framework designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It takes in Python code as input and outputs a web application, allowing developers to choose their own tools and libraries. A key behavior of Flask is its flexibility, offering suggestions but not enforcing dependencies or project layout, and its extensibility through community-provided extensions.

## Key Components / Concepts
The Flask framework is built around several key components, including the application instance, routes, templates, and extensions. The application instance is the core of the Flask application, and is created using the `Flask` class. Routes are used to map URLs to specific functions or methods, and are defined using the `@app.route` decorator. Templates are used to render dynamic content, and are defined using the Jinja2 templating engine. Extensions are used to add additional functionality to the Flask application, and are provided by the community.

## How it Works
The Flask framework works by creating a web application instance, defining routes and templates, and running the application using a WSGI server. The application instance is created by instantiating the `Flask` class, and passing in the name of the current module. Routes are defined using the `@app.route` decorator, which maps a URL to a specific function or method. Templates are defined using the Jinja2 templating engine, and are rendered using the `render_template` function. The application is run using a WSGI server, such as the built-in development server or a production server like Gunicorn.

## Example(s)
Here is an example of a simple Flask application:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```
This application creates a web server that listens on port 5000, and responds to requests to the root URL ("/") with the string "Hello, World!".
