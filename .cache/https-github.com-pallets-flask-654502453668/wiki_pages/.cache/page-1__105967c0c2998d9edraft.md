# Flask Overview
## Overview
Flask is a lightweight web application framework designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It takes in Python code as input and outputs a web application, allowing developers to choose their own tools and libraries. A key behavior of Flask is its flexibility, offering suggestions but not enforcing dependencies or project layout, and its extensibility through community-provided extensions. By using Flask, developers can create web applications with custom functionality and layouts.

## Key Components / Concepts
The core components of Flask include the application instance, routes, templates, and extensions. The application instance is the central object of a Flask application, and it is created by instantiating the `Flask` class. Routes are used to map URLs to specific functions in the application, and templates are used to render dynamic content. Extensions are libraries that provide additional functionality to Flask applications.

## How it Works
Flask works by using the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) to handle HTTP requests and responses. When a request is made to a Flask application, the application instance is created, and the route for the requested URL is determined. The function associated with the route is then called, and its return value is used to generate the response. Flask also provides a number of built-in functions and classes for tasks such as handling forms, working with databases, and authenticating users.

## Example(s)
Here is a simple example of a Flask application:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```
This application creates a single route for the root URL ("/") and returns the string "Hello, World!" when that route is accessed.

This flowchart shows the basic flow of a Flask application, from receiving a request to sending a response.
