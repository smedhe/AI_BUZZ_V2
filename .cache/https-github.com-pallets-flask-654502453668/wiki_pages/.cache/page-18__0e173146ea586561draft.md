# Introduction to Flask
## Overview
Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework designed to make getting started quick and easy. It is a flexible framework that allows developers to build web applications without imposing a fixed project structure or mandatory dependencies. Flask offers suggestions, but it is up to the developer to choose the tools and libraries they want to use.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components of Flask include the Flask application object, routes, view functions, and templates. The Flask application object is the core of the framework, and it is used to configure the application and define routes. Routes are used to map URLs to view functions, which are responsible for handling HTTP requests and returning responses. Templates are used to render dynamic content in HTML pages.

## How it Works
Flask works by using the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) protocol to communicate with web servers. When a request is made to a Flask application, the application uses the WSGI protocol to receive the request and send a response back to the client. The application uses routes to determine which view function to call to handle the request, and the view function returns a response that is sent back to the client.

## Example(s)
Here is an example of a simple Flask application:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"
```
This application defines a single route for the root URL ("/") and returns the string "Hello, World!" when that route is accessed.

This diagram shows the flow of a request through a Flask application.
