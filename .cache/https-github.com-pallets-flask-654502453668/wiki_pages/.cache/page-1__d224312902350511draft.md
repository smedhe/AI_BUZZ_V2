# Project Overview
## Overview
Flask is a lightweight web application framework designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It takes in Python code as input and outputs a web application, allowing developers to choose their own tools and libraries. A key behavior of Flask is its flexibility, offering suggestions but not enforcing dependencies or project layout, and its extensibility through community-provided extensions.

## Key Components / Concepts
The core components of Flask include the application instance, routes, templates, and request and response objects. The application instance is the central object in Flask, and it is used to configure the application and register routes. Routes are used to map URLs to specific functions in the application, and templates are used to render dynamic content. Request and response objects are used to handle HTTP requests and responses.

## How it Works
Flask works by using the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) standard to interface with web servers. When a request is made to the application, Flask uses the route mappings to determine which function to call. The function is then called with the request object as an argument, and it returns a response object. Flask then uses the response object to generate the HTTP response.

## Example(s)
A simple example of a Flask application is:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"
```
This application defines a single route for the root URL ("/") and returns the string "Hello, World!" when that route is accessed.
