# Introduction to Flask
## Overview
Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja, and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks. Flask offers suggestions, but doesn't enforce any dependencies or project layout, giving developers the freedom to choose the tools and libraries they want to use.

## Key Components / Concepts
The core components of Flask include the application object, routes, and view functions. The application object is the central instance of the Flask class, which is responsible for configuring the application and providing access to its functionality. Routes are used to map URLs to specific view functions, which handle the request and return a response. View functions can be used to render templates, handle form data, and perform other tasks.

## How it Works
When a request is made to a Flask application, the application object uses the route configuration to determine which view function to call. The view function is then executed, and its return value is used to generate the response. Flask also provides a number of built-in features, such as support for templates, internationalization, and debugging.

## Example(s)
A simple example of a Flask application is:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"
```
This application defines a single route, `/`, which maps to the `hello` view function. When a request is made to this route, the `hello` function is called, and its return value is used to generate the response.

## Diagram(s)

    participant Client as "Client"
    participant Flask as "Flask Application"
    participant View as "View Function"

    Client->>Flask: Request
    Flask->>View: Call View Function
    View->>Flask: Return Response
    Flask->>Client: Send Response
```
This diagram shows the basic flow of a request through a Flask application. The client makes a request to the application, which calls the corresponding view function. The view function returns a response, which is then sent back to the client.
