# Caching Patterns
## Overview
Caching is a crucial aspect of web development, as it enables the storage and reuse of frequently accessed data, reducing the load on the application and improving performance. In Flask, caching can be implemented using various strategies, including built-in helpers and third-party libraries. This section will explore the different caching patterns available in Flask, their implementation, and best practices.

## Key Components / Concepts
To implement caching in Flask, several key components and concepts need to be understood:

* **Cache**: A cache is a temporary storage area that holds frequently accessed data. In Flask, caches can be implemented using various backends, such as memory, file system, or database.
* **Cache key**: A cache key is a unique identifier used to store and retrieve cached data. In Flask, cache keys are typically generated based on the request URL, query parameters, and other relevant factors.
* **Cache expiration**: Cache expiration refers to the time period after which cached data is considered stale and needs to be refreshed. In Flask, cache expiration can be configured using various strategies, such as time-to-live (TTL) or cache invalidation.

## How it Works
Flask provides several built-in helpers for implementing caching, including:

* **`flask.cache`**: The `flask.cache` module provides a simple caching interface that can be used to store and retrieve cached data.
* **`flask.g`**: The `flask.g` object is a global object that can be used to store cached data that is shared across requests.

To implement caching in Flask, the following steps can be taken:

1. Choose a cache backend: Flask supports various cache backends, including memory, file system, and database.
2. Configure the cache: The cache can be configured using various strategies, such as TTL or cache invalidation.
3. Generate a cache key: A cache key is generated based on the request URL, query parameters, and other relevant factors.
4. Store cached data: The cached data is stored in the cache using the generated cache key.
5. Retrieve cached data: The cached data is retrieved from the cache using the generated cache key.

## Example(s)
Here is an example of how to implement caching in Flask using the `flask.cache` module:
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
from flask.cache import Cache

app = Flask(__name__)
cache = Cache(app, config={'CACHE_TYPE': 'simple'})

@app.route('/')
@cache.cached(timeout=60)  # cache for 1 minute
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')
```
In this example, the `index` function is decorated with the `@cache.cached` decorator, which caches the response for 1 minute.
