# Introduction to Examples
## Overview
The Flask Wiki repository provides a comprehensive set of examples to demonstrate the usage and capabilities of the Flask framework. These examples are designed to help developers understand how to build robust and scalable web applications using Flask. In this section, we will introduce the different types of examples available in the repository and provide an overview of their purpose and functionality.

## Key Components / Concepts
The examples in the Flask Wiki repository are organized into several categories, including:

* **Tutorial examples**: These examples provide a step-by-step guide to building a simple web application using Flask. They cover the basics of routing, templating, and database integration.
* **Advanced examples**: These examples demonstrate more complex features of Flask, such as authentication, authorization, and caching.
* **Integration examples**: These examples show how to integrate Flask with other frameworks and libraries, such as Celery and JavaScript.
* **Best practices examples**: These examples illustrate how to follow best practices when building Flask applications, such as using secure password storage and validating user input.

## How it Works
Each example in the repository is a self-contained Flask application that can be run independently. The examples are designed to be easy to understand and modify, allowing developers to experiment with different features and techniques. The examples also include documentation and comments to explain how the code works and why certain design decisions were made.

## Example(s)
For example, the `examples/tutorial` directory contains a simple web application that demonstrates how to build a blog using Flask. The application includes routes for displaying a list of blog posts, creating new posts, and editing existing posts. The example also includes a database schema and sample data to illustrate how to use Flask's database integration features.

This diagram illustrates the basic flow of a Flask application, from receiving a request from the user to sending a response back to the user.
