# Common Patterns Index
## Overview
The Common Patterns Index is a collection of documentation that demonstrates typical Flask use-cases. It provides a comprehensive overview of the key components, concepts, and workflows involved in building a Flask application. This index serves as a starting point for developers looking to understand the best practices and common patterns used in Flask development.

## Key Components / Concepts
Flask is a micro web framework that provides a flexible and modular way to build web applications. The key components of a Flask application include routes, views, templates, and models. Routes define the URLs that map to specific views, which handle HTTP requests and return responses. Templates are used to render HTML pages, while models represent the data structures used in the application.

## How it Works
A Flask application works by defining routes that map to specific views. When a request is made to a URL, the corresponding view is called, and it returns a response. The response can be an HTML page, a JSON object, or any other type of data. Flask also provides a range of tools and libraries to help with tasks such as database integration, authentication, and caching.

## Example(s)
One common pattern in Flask is the use of blueprints to organize routes and views. A blueprint is a self-contained component that defines a set of routes and views. Blueprints can be used to break down a large application into smaller, more manageable pieces.

For example, the `tests/test_blueprints.py` file defines a blueprint that includes an `about` function, which generates a URL for the index page of a Flask application.
```python
def about():
    return flask.url_for(".index")
```
This function takes no inputs and returns a URL string. The key side-effect of this function is that it redirects to the index page when called.

## Diagram(s)

    C -->|Response|> D[Client]
    D -->|Request|> B
```
This flowchart shows the basic workflow of a Flask application. A request is made to a URL, which is routed to a specific view. The view handles the request and returns a response, which is sent back to the client.
