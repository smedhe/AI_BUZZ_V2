# Project Configuration
## Overview
The project configuration is a crucial aspect of the Flask Wiki application, as it determines how the application behaves and interacts with its environment. In this section, we will delve into the configuration files used by the application, including `pyproject.toml` and `.editorconfig`.

## Key Components / Concepts
The project configuration consists of several key components and concepts, including:

* `pyproject.toml`: This file defines the build and packaging metadata for the Flask web framework, including dependencies, entry points, and other configuration settings.
* `.editorconfig`: This file establishes the coding style for the project, including indentation, line endings, and encoding.
* Configuration loading: The application uses various methods to load configuration settings, including `app.config.from_pyfile`, `app.config.from_object`, and `app.config.from_file`.

## How it Works
The project configuration works as follows:

1. The `pyproject.toml` file is used to define the build and packaging metadata for the application.
2. The `.editorconfig` file is used to establish the coding style for the project.
3. The application loads configuration settings using various methods, such as `app.config.from_pyfile` and `app.config.from_object`.
4. The loaded configuration settings are used to determine the behavior of the application, including settings such as database connections, authentication, and caching.

## Example(s)
Here is an example of how to load configuration settings from a Python file using `app.config.from_pyfile`:
```python
app = flask.Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_pyfile('config.py')
```
This code loads the configuration settings from a file named `config.py` in the current working directory.
