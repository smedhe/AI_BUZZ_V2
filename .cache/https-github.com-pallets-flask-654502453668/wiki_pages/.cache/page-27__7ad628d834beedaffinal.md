# Example Application
## Overview
The example application is a simple Flask web application that demonstrates the basic structure and functionality of a Flask app, utilizing key components such as routes and a Flask application instance.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components of the example application include:
* A Flask application instance, created using `Flask(__name__)`
* Routes for handling HTTP requests, defined using the `@app.route()` decorator
* A simple "Hello, World!" example, returned as a response to an HTTP request

## How it Works
The example application works by creating a Flask application instance and defining routes for handling HTTP requests. The routes are used to map URLs to specific functions that handle the requests. For instance, the `/` route is mapped to the `hello()` function, which returns the "Hello, World!" message.

## Example(s)
An example of a simple "Hello, World!" application is shown below:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"
```
This example demonstrates how to create a basic Flask application with a single route.

    Client->>Flask: Send HTTP Request
    Flask->>Server: Handle Request
    Server->>Flask: Return Response
    Flask->>Client: Return Response to Client
```
