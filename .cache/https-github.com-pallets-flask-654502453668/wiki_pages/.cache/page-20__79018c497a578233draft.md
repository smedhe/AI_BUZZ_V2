# Documentation Build Setup
## Overview
The documentation build setup for the Flask project is configured using the `.readthedocs.yaml` file. This file defines the build process for the documentation, including the operating system, Python version, and commands to install and run the necessary tools. The configuration specifies the use of `uv` and `Sphinx` to build the documentation, and the output is generated in the specified directory.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components of the documentation build setup include:
* `.readthedocs.yaml`: The configuration file for Read the Docs, defining the build process for the documentation.
* `uv`: A tool used to manage dependencies and run commands during the build process.
* `Sphinx`: A documentation generator used to build the HTML documentation files.
* `README.md`: The main README file for the project, which is used as the entry point for the documentation.

## How it Works
The documentation build process works as follows:
1. The `.readthedocs.yaml` file is read and parsed to determine the build configuration.
2. The `uv` tool is used to install the necessary dependencies, including `Sphinx`.
3. The `Sphinx` documentation generator is run to build the HTML documentation files.
4. The output is generated in the specified directory, which is defined in the `.readthedocs.yaml` file.

## Example(s)
An example of the `.readthedocs.yaml` file is shown below:
```yml
version: 2
build:
  os: ubuntu-24.04
  tools:
    python: '3.13'
  commands:
    - asdf plugin add uv
    - asdf install uv latest
    - asdf global uv latest
    - uv run --group docs sphinx-build -W -b dirhtml docs $READTHEDOCS_OUTPUT/html
```
This example shows the configuration for building the documentation using `uv` and `Sphinx`.
