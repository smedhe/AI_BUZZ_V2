# Application and Request Context
## Overview
The application and request contexts are fundamental concepts in Flask, a micro web framework. They provide a way to manage the state of an application and its requests, allowing for a clean and organized way to handle the complexities of web development. In this section, we will delve into the details of these contexts, exploring their purpose, functionality, and usage.

## Key Components / Concepts
The application context and request context are two separate but related concepts in Flask. The application context is an object that represents the current application, providing access to its configuration, routes, and other relevant data. The request context, on the other hand, represents a single request to the application, containing information such as the request method, path, and data.

The `app_context` and `request_context` objects are used to manage these contexts, providing methods for pushing and popping contexts, as well as accessing the current context. The `current_app` and `request` objects are used to access the current application and request contexts, respectively.

## How it Works
When a request is made to a Flask application, a new request context is created and pushed onto the context stack. This context is then used to handle the request, providing access to the request data and the application configuration. Once the request is handled, the request context is popped from the stack, and the application context is updated accordingly.

The application context is created when the application is initialized, and it is used to manage the application's configuration, routes, and other data. The application context is also used to handle tasks such as URL generation and request dispatching.

## Example(s)
Here is an example of how to use the `app_context` and `request_context` objects to manage the application and request contexts:
```python
from flask import Flask, app_context, request_context

app = Flask(__name__)

with app_context():
    # Access the application configuration
    print(app.config)

with request_context('/'):
    # Access the request data
    print(request.path)
```
In this example, we create a new Flask application and use the `app_context` object to access the application configuration. We then use the `request_context` object to create a new request context and access the request data.
