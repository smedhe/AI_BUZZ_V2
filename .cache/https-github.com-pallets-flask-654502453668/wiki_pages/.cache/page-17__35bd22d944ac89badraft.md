# Celery Worker
## Overview
The Celery worker is a crucial component in the Flask Wiki repository, responsible for handling asynchronous tasks and providing a scalable solution for managing background jobs. This page provides an in-depth look at the Celery worker, its architecture, key components, and how it works.

## Key Components / Concepts
The Celery worker relies on several key components to function effectively:
* **Celery**: An asynchronous task queue that allows you to run tasks in the background.
* **RabbitMQ**: A message broker that handles task messages and provides a scalable solution for managing task queues.
* **Worker nodes**: These are the machines that run the Celery worker and execute tasks.

## How it Works
The Celery worker works by receiving task messages from the message broker (RabbitMQ) and executing them in the background. Here's a high-level overview of the process:
1. A task is sent to the message broker (RabbitMQ) by the Flask application.
2. The Celery worker connects to the message broker and receives the task message.
3. The Celery worker executes the task and sends the result back to the message broker.
4. The result is then retrieved by the Flask application and processed accordingly.

## Example(s)
To illustrate how the Celery worker works, let's consider an example where we want to send a welcome email to a new user. We can create a task that sends the email and run it in the background using the Celery worker.

```python
from celery import Celery
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
celery = Celery(app.name, broker='amqp://guest@localhost//')

@celery.task
def send_welcome_email(user_id):
    # Send welcome email to user
    pass
```

## Diagram(s)
Here's a sequence diagram that illustrates the interaction between the Flask application, Celery worker, and message broker:
