# Deploying Flask Applications
## Overview
Flask is a lightweight WSGI-based Python web framework that lets developers quickly create web applications by defining routes and returning responses. To deploy a Flask application, you need to use a WSGI server and a deployment tool. In this section, we will cover the key components and concepts involved in deploying Flask applications.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components involved in deploying Flask applications are:
* WSGI servers: These are the servers that run the Flask application. Some popular WSGI servers include Gunicorn, uWSGI, and Waitress.
* Deployment tools: These are the tools that help you manage and deploy your Flask application. Some popular deployment tools include Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible.
* Cloud platforms: These are the platforms that provide the infrastructure for deploying your Flask application. Some popular cloud platforms include AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.

## How it Works
To deploy a Flask application, you need to follow these steps:
1. Create a Flask application: This involves defining routes and returning responses using the Flask framework.
2. Choose a WSGI server: You need to choose a WSGI server that can run your Flask application. Some popular WSGI servers include Gunicorn, uWSGI, and Waitress.
3. Configure the WSGI server: You need to configure the WSGI server to run your Flask application. This involves specifying the application instance, the port number, and other settings.
4. Choose a deployment tool: You need to choose a deployment tool that can help you manage and deploy your Flask application. Some popular deployment tools include Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible.
5. Configure the deployment tool: You need to configure the deployment tool to deploy your Flask application. This involves specifying the application instance, the WSGI server, and other settings.
6. Deploy the application: Once you have configured the WSGI server and the deployment tool, you can deploy your Flask application.

## Example(s)
Here is an example of how to deploy a Flask application using Gunicorn and Docker:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```
To deploy this application using Gunicorn and Docker, you need to create a `Dockerfile` that specifies the application instance and the WSGI server:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["gunicorn", "app:app", "--workers", "3"]
```
You can then build the Docker image and run it using the following commands:
```bash
docker build -t myapp .
docker run -p 5000:5000 myapp
```
This will deploy the Flask application using Gunicorn and make it available at `http://localhost:5000`.
