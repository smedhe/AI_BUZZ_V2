# Request and Response Wrappers
## Overview
The Request and Response objects in Flask are wrappers around the Werkzeug primitives, providing a more convenient and Pythonic interface for handling HTTP requests and responses. These objects are crucial components of the Flask framework, enabling developers to interact with the HTTP protocol in a straightforward and intuitive manner.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components involved in the implementation of Request and Response wrappers in Flask include:
- `flask.Request`: This object represents an HTTP request and provides attributes and methods for accessing request data, such as headers, form data, and query parameters.
- `flask.Response`: This object represents an HTTP response and provides methods for setting response data, such as status codes, headers, and response bodies.
- `flask.make_response`: This function is used to create a Response object from various types of data, including strings, tuples, and dictionaries.

## How it Works
When a request is made to a Flask application, the `flask.Request` object is created to represent the incoming request. This object is then used by the application's routes to access request data and generate a response. The response is typically created using the `flask.make_response` function, which takes the response data as an argument and returns a `flask.Response` object. This Response object is then returned by the route and sent back to the client.

## Example(s)
Here is an example of how to create a simple route in Flask that returns a Response object:
```python
from flask import Flask, make_response

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return make_response('Hello, World!', 200)
```
In this example, the `make_response` function is used to create a Response object with the string 'Hello, World!' as the response body and a status code of 200.

This flowchart illustrates the process of handling an HTTP request in Flask, from the client making the request to the Flask application sending the response back to the client.
