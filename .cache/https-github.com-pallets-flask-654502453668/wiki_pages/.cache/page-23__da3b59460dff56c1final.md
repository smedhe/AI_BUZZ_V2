# Request and Response Objects
## Overview
Flask provides a request object to handle HTTP requests and a response object to handle HTTP responses. These objects are crucial in handling HTTP requests and responses in a Flask application, and can be found in the `src/flask/globals.py` and `src/flask/wrappers.py` files.

## Key Components / Concepts
The request object provides information about the HTTP request, such as the method, path, and data. The response object, on the other hand, is used to generate the HTTP response, including the status code, headers, and body. The `request` object is an instance of `Request` class, and the `response` object is an instance of `Response` class.

## How it Works
When a request is made to a Flask application, the request object is created and passed to the view function. The view function then processes the request and returns a response object. The response object is then used to generate the HTTP response. This process is tested in the `tests/test_basic.py` and `tests/test_views.py` files.

## Example(s)
Here's an example of how to use the request and response objects in a Flask view function:
```python
from flask import Flask, request, Response

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    if request.method == 'GET':
        return Response('Hello, World!', status=200)
    elif request.method == 'POST':
        return Response('Hello, World!', status=201)
```
