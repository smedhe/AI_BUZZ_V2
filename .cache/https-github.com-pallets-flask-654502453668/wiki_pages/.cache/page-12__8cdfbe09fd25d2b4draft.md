# CLI and Application Startup
## Overview
The Flask command-line interface (CLI) is a powerful tool for managing and running Flask applications. It provides a simple and intuitive way to perform various tasks, such as running the development server, creating database tables, and executing custom commands. In this section, we will explore how the Flask CLI discovers and launches an application.

## Key Components / Concepts
The Flask CLI relies on several key components to function properly. These include:

* `FlaskGroup`: a custom command group that provides the foundation for the Flask CLI.
* `ScriptInfo`: an object that contains information about the application, such as its name and import path.
* `locate_app`: a function that attempts to find the application instance based on the provided import path.
* `prepare_import`: a function that prepares the application instance for import.

## How it Works
When the Flask CLI is invoked, it uses the `locate_app` function to find the application instance. This function takes the import path as input and attempts to find the application instance. If the application instance is found, it is then prepared for import using the `prepare_import` function.

The `prepare_import` function sets up the application instance and makes it available for import. This function is responsible for creating the application instance if it does not already exist.

Once the application instance is prepared, the Flask CLI uses the `FlaskGroup` command group to execute the desired command. The `FlaskGroup` command group provides a set of built-in commands, such as `run` and `shell`, that can be used to manage the application.

## Example(s)
Here is an example of how to use the Flask CLI to run a development server:
```bash
flask run
```
This command will start the development server and make the application available at `http://localhost:5000`.

```
This diagram illustrates the flow of the Flask CLI when invoked. The `locate_app` function is used to find the application instance, which is then prepared for import using the `prepare_import` function. The `FlaskGroup` command group is then used to execute the desired command.
