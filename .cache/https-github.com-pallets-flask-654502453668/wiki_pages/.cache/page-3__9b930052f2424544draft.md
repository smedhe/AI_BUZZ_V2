# Readthedocs Configuration
## Overview
The Readthedocs configuration is a crucial aspect of the Flask Wiki project, as it enables the automated building and hosting of the project's documentation. The configuration file, `.readthedocs.yaml`, provides Read the Docs with the necessary instructions to build the project's documentation.

## Key Components / Concepts
The `.readthedocs.yaml` file specifies the build environment, tools, and commands required to build the documentation. The key components of this file include:
* `version`: The version of the Read the Docs configuration format.
* `build`: The build environment and tools.
* `os`: The operating system used for building, which is set to Ubuntu 24.04.
* `tools`: The tools required for building, which includes Python 3.13.
* `commands`: The commands executed during the build process, which includes installing the `uv` package manager, making it the global version, and running `uv run` to invoke Sphinx.

## How it Works
The Readthedocs configuration works by specifying the build environment and tools required to build the project's documentation. When the documentation is built, Read the Docs uses the specified environment and tools to execute the commands outlined in the `.readthedocs.yaml` file. This process involves:
1. Installing the `uv` package manager via `asdf`.
2. Making `uv` the global version.
3. Running `uv run` to invoke Sphinx, which builds the documentation in the `docs` folder as a `dirhtml` site.

## Example(s)
An example of a `.readthedocs.yaml` file is provided below:
```yml
version: 2
build:
  os: ubuntu-24.04
  tools:
    python: '3.13'
  commands:
    - asdf plugin add uv
    - asdf install uv latest
    - asdf global uv latest
    - uv run --group docs sphinx-build -W -b dirhtml docs $READTHEDOCS_OUTPUT/html
```
This example demonstrates how to specify the build environment, tools, and commands required to build the project's documentation.
