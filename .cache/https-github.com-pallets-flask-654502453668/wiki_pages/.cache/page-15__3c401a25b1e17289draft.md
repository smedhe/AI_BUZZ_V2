# Authentication and Authorization
## Overview
Authentication and authorization are crucial components in any web application, ensuring that only authorized users can access and manipulate sensitive data. In the context of the Flask Wiki repository, these features are implemented to provide a secure and controlled environment for users to interact with the application.

## Key Components / Concepts
The authentication and authorization system in Flask Wiki relies on several key components and concepts, including:

* **User sessions**: Flask uses sessions to store user data, such as the user ID, to keep track of authenticated users.
* **Login and logout functionality**: The application provides login and logout functionality to manage user sessions.
* **Access control**: The application implements access control mechanisms to restrict access to certain routes and resources based on user roles and permissions.
* **Error handling**: The application includes error handling mechanisms to handle authentication and authorization errors, such as invalid login credentials or forbidden access.

## How it Works
The authentication and authorization process in Flask Wiki works as follows:

1. **User login**: A user attempts to log in to the application by providing their credentials, such as username and password.
2. **Authentication**: The application verifies the user's credentials and checks if they are valid. If the credentials are valid, the application creates a new user session and stores the user ID in the session.
3. **Authorization**: The application checks the user's role and permissions to determine what resources and routes they can access.
4. **Access control**: The application enforces access control mechanisms to restrict access to certain routes and resources based on the user's role and permissions.

## Example(s)
For example, the `login` function in `tests/test_basic.py` simulates a user authentication by hard-coding the session's `user_id` to 1 and marking the Flask session as permanent:
```python
def login():
    flask.session["user_id"] = 1
    flask.session.permanent = True
    return ""
```
This function demonstrates how the application can create a new user session and store the user ID in the session.

## Diagram(s)
The following Mermaid diagram illustrates the authentication and authorization process in Flask Wiki:

```
This diagram shows the flow of the authentication and authorization process, from user login to access control.
