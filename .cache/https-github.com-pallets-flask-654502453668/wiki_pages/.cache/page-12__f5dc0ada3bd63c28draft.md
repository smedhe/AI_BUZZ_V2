# Celery Example
## Overview
The Celery example provided in the repository demonstrates how to integrate Celery, a distributed task queue, with a Flask web application. This example showcases the basic setup and usage of Celery in a Flask project, including defining tasks, creating a Celery application instance, and configuring it to work with a Flask app.

## Key Components / Concepts
To understand the Celery example, it's essential to grasp the key components involved:
- **Celery Application**: The core of Celery, responsible for managing tasks and workers.
- **Tasks**: Functions that are executed by Celery workers. In the context of the example, tasks are defined in `examples/celery/src/task_app/tasks.py`.
- **Flask Application**: The web application framework used to build the web interface and API. The example integrates Celery with a Flask app defined in `examples/celery/src/task_app/views.py`.
- **Broker**: A message broker (like RabbitMQ or Redis) that Celery uses to store and manage task messages. The example likely uses a broker to facilitate communication between the Celery application and its workers.

## How it Works
1. **Task Definition**: Tasks are defined as Python functions using the `@app.task` decorator, where `app` is an instance of the Celery application. These tasks can perform any operation, such as database queries, file processing, or API calls.
2. **Celery Application Setup**: The Celery application instance is created and configured. This involves setting up the broker, result backend, and other parameters necessary for Celery to operate.
3. **Task Execution**: When a task is called, it is sent to the broker, which then distributes it to an available worker. The worker executes the task and sends the result back to the broker.
4. **Result Retrieval**: The result of the task execution can be retrieved from the broker or result backend, depending on the configuration.

## Example(s)
Consider a simple task defined in `tasks.py` that adds two numbers:
```python
from celery import Celery

app = Celery('tasks', broker='amqp://guest@localhost//')

@app.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```
This task can be called from a Flask view, like so:
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from tasks import add

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/add/<int:x>/<int:y>', methods=['GET'])
def view_add(x, y):
    result = add.delay(x, y)
    return jsonify({'id': result.id})
```
The `add.delay(x, y)` call sends the task to the broker without blocking, allowing the Flask view to return immediately.
