# Introduction to Flask Examples
## Overview
Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework that enables developers to quickly create and scale web applications. It provides a flexible and modular structure, allowing developers to choose their own dependencies and project layout.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components of Flask include the application instance, routes, and templates. The application instance is the core of the Flask application, and routes are used to map URLs to specific functions. Templates are used to render HTML pages.

## How it Works
Flask works by creating an application instance and defining routes for the application. The application instance is then run using the `flask run` command, which starts the development server.

## Example(s)
Here is an example of a simple Flask application:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"
```
This application defines a single route for the root URL ("/") and returns the string "Hello, World!".

## Diagram(s)

    participant Client as "Client"
    participant Server as "Server"
    participant Flask as "Flask"
    
    Client->>Server: Request
    Server->>Flask: Receive Request
    Flask->>Server: Process Request
    Server->>Client: Response
```
This diagram shows the flow of a request from the client to the server and how Flask processes the request.
