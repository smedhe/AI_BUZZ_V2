# Example Applications
## Overview
The Flask repository includes several example applications that demonstrate how to use the framework to build web applications. These examples range from simple "Hello World" applications to more complex applications that use blueprints and templates. In this section, we will explore two of these example applications: `helloworld` and `blueprintapp`.

## Key Components / Concepts
The `helloworld` application is a minimal Flask application that serves a single route at "/". When a client accesses this endpoint, the `hello` view function returns the plain-text response "Hello World!". This application demonstrates the basic structure of a Flask application, including the creation of a Flask instance and the definition of a route.

The `blueprintapp` application is a more complex example that uses blueprints to organize its routes and view functions. A blueprint is a way to group related routes and view functions together, making it easier to manage large applications. In `blueprintapp`, we define two blueprints: `admin` and `frontend`. Each blueprint has its own set of routes and view functions, and we register them with the main Flask application instance.

## How it Works
To understand how these example applications work, let's take a closer look at the code. In `helloworld`, we create a Flask instance and define a single route at "/" using the `@app.route` decorator. When a client accesses this endpoint, the `hello` view function is called, and it returns the plain-text response "Hello World!".

In `blueprintapp`, we define two blueprints: `admin` and `frontend`. Each blueprint has its own set of routes and view functions, and we register them with the main Flask application instance using the `app.register_blueprint` method. This allows us to organize our routes and view functions in a logical and modular way.

## Example(s)
Let's take a closer look at the code for `helloworld` and `blueprintapp`. In `helloworld`, we have the following code:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"
```
In `blueprintapp`, we have the following code:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config["DEBUG"] = True

from blueprintapp.apps.admin import admin
from blueprintapp.apps.frontend import frontend

app.register_blueprint(admin)
app.register_blueprint(frontend)
```
## Diagram(s)
Here is a Mermaid diagram that shows the structure of the `blueprintapp` application:

```
This diagram shows how the `blueprintapp` application is structured, with the main Flask instance registering two blueprints: `admin` and `frontend`. Each blueprint has its own set of routes, which are registered with the main Flask instance.
