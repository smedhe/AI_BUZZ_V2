# Celery Integration
## Overview
Celery is a distributed task queue that can be used to run tasks asynchronously in the background. It is a popular choice for Flask applications that need to perform long-running tasks, such as sending emails or processing large datasets. In this section, we will explore how to integrate Celery with Flask.

## Key Components / Concepts
To use Celery with Flask, we need to install the `celery` package and create a Celery instance. We also need to define tasks, which are functions that will be executed by Celery. Tasks can be defined using the `@app.task` decorator, where `app` is the Celery instance.

## How it Works
Here is an example of how Celery works with Flask:
1. The user sends a request to the Flask application.
2. The Flask application creates a task and sends it to the Celery broker (e.g. RabbitMQ).
3. The Celery worker receives the task from the broker and executes it.
4. The result of the task is stored in the Celery backend (e.g. Redis).

## Example(s)
Let's consider an example where we want to send an email asynchronously using Celery. We can define a task `send_email` that takes the recipient's email address and the email content as arguments.
```python
from celery import Celery
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
celery = Celery(app.name, broker='amqp://guest@localhost//')

@celery.task
def send_email(recipient, content):
    # Send the email using a mail server
    print(f"Sending email to {recipient} with content {content}")
```
We can then call this task from our Flask route:
```python
from flask import request

@app.route('/send_email', methods=['POST'])
def send_email_route():
    recipient = request.form['recipient']
    content = request.form['content']
    send_email.apply_async(args=[recipient, content])
    return 'Email sent!'
```
## Diagram(s)

    participant Flask as "Flask Application"
    participant Celery as "Celery Worker"
    participant Broker as "Celery Broker"
    participant Backend as "Celery Backend"

    note "User sends request to Flask"
    Flask->>Broker: Send task to broker
    Broker->>Celery: Receive task from broker
    Celery->>Celery: Execute task
    Celery->>Backend: Store result in backend
    Backend->>Flask: Return result to Flask
    Flask->>User: Return result to user
```
This diagram shows the flow of tasks between the Flask application, Celery worker, broker, and backend.
