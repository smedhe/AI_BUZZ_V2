# Tutorial Example
## Overview
The tutorial example provided in the repository is a comprehensive guide to building a Flask application. It covers various aspects of the framework, including routing, templating, and database interactions. This example is designed to help new developers understand the basics of Flask and how to build a fully functional web application.

## Key Components / Concepts
The tutorial example consists of several key components, including:

* Routing: The example demonstrates how to define routes for a Flask application using the `@app.route()` decorator.
* Templating: The example shows how to use Jinja2 templating to render HTML templates with dynamic data.
* Database interactions: The example demonstrates how to interact with a database using Flask-SQLAlchemy.
* Authentication and authorization: The example shows how to implement authentication and authorization using Flask-Login and Flask-Principal.

## How it Works
The tutorial example works by defining a series of routes that handle different HTTP requests. Each route is associated with a specific function that handles the request and returns a response. The example also uses templating to render HTML pages with dynamic data.

## Example(s)
For example, the `index` function in `tests/test_blueprints.py` renders the `template_test.html` page with a context variable `value` set to `False`. This function takes no parameters and returns the rendered template as a response.

```python
def index():
    return flask.render_template("template_test.html", value=False)
```

## Diagram(s)

    participant Database as "Database"

    note "Client sends HTTP request to Server"
    Client->>Server: HTTP Request
    Server->>Database: Query Database
    Database->>Server: Return Data
    Server->>Client: HTTP Response
```
This flowchart shows the interaction between the client, server, and database in the tutorial example.
