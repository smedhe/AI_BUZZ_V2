# Celery Integration
## Overview
Celery is a distributed task queue that can be integrated with Flask to run tasks asynchronously in the background. This allows for more efficient use of resources and improved performance.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components of Celery integration with Flask include:
* A Celery instance
* A Flask application
* A broker (e.g. RabbitMQ, Redis) to handle task messages
* A backend (e.g. Redis, Database) to store task results

## How it Works
Here is a high-level overview of how Celery integration with Flask works:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Flask App as "Flask Application"
    participant Celery as "Celery Instance"
    participant Broker as "Broker (e.g. RabbitMQ)"
    participant Backend as "Backend (e.g. Redis)"
    Flask App->>Celery: Send task to Celery
    Celery->>Broker: Send task message to broker
    Broker->>Celery: Send task message to worker
    Celery->>Backend: Store task result
    Celery->>Flask App: Return task result
```
## Example(s)
An example of using Celery with Flask can be found in the `examples/celery` directory.

## Diagram(s)
Here is a more detailed diagram of the Celery architecture:

    C -->|send task message|> D[Worker]
    D -->|execute task|> E[Result]
    E -->|store result|> F[Backend]
    F -->|return result|> A
```
