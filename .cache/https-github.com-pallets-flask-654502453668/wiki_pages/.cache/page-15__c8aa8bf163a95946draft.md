# Authentication and Authorization
## Overview
The Flask framework provides a basic structure for authentication and authorization through its support for sessions and request contexts. However, it does not include built-in authentication or authorization mechanisms, leaving the implementation of these features to the developer.

## Key Components / Concepts
- **Sessions**: Flask uses sessions to store data that should be available across requests. Sessions are a key component in implementing authentication, as they can be used to store user IDs or other identifying information.
- **Request Context**: The request context is an object that stores data related to the current request, such as the request method, path, and any data sent with the request.

## How it Works
1. A user attempts to access a protected resource.
2. The application checks if the user is authenticated by looking for a user ID in the session.
3. If the user is not authenticated, they are redirected to a login page.
4. The user enters their credentials and submits the login form.
5. The application verifies the user's credentials and, if they are valid, sets the user ID in the session.
6. The user is then redirected back to the protected resource, which they can now access because their user ID is stored in the session.

## Example(s)
An example of how to implement basic authentication in Flask can be seen in the `examples/tutorial/flaskr/auth.py` file, where a login function sets the user ID in the session after verifying the user's credentials.
