# Testing Strategy
## Overview
The testing strategy for Flask core and example applications utilizes pytest, a popular testing framework for Python. This approach enables developers to write and run tests efficiently, ensuring the reliability and stability of the Flask framework. The tests cover various aspects of Flask, including environment defaults, client behavior, request context, and error handling.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components involved in the testing strategy are:
* **pytest**: The testing framework used to write and run tests for Flask.
* **Flask application instance**: The instance of the Flask application being tested.
* **Client object**: The object used to simulate requests to the Flask application.
* **Test fixtures**: Pre-defined setup and teardown functions that provide a consistent environment for testing.

## How it Works
The testing process involves the following steps:
1. **Setup**: The test fixture sets up the Flask application instance and client object.
2. **Test execution**: The test function executes the test case, using the client object to simulate requests to the Flask application.
3. **Assertion**: The test function asserts the expected behavior of the Flask application.
4. **Teardown**: The test fixture tears down the Flask application instance and client object.

## Example(s)
For example, the `test_environ_defaults_from_config` function in `tests/test_testing.py` tests the environment defaults of a Flask application:
```python
def test_environ_defaults_from_config(app, client):
    app.config["SERVER_NAME"] = "example.com:1234"
    app.config["APPLICATION_ROOT"] = "/foo"

    @app.route("/")
    def index():
        return flask.request.url

    ctx = app.test_request_context()
    assert ctx.request.url == "http://example.com:1234/foo/"

    rv = client.get("/")
    assert rv.data == b"http://example.com:1234/foo/"
```
This test function sets up the Flask application instance with specific configuration values, defines a route, and then asserts the expected behavior of the application.

    Client->>Flask: Simulate request
    Flask->>Client: Respond to request
    Client->>Pytest: Assert expected behavior
    Pytest->>Flask: Teardown test fixture
```
This flowchart illustrates the interaction between the pytest framework, the Flask application instance, and the client object during the testing process.
