# Authentication and Authorization
## Overview
Authentication and authorization are crucial components in any web application, ensuring that only authorized users can access and manipulate sensitive data. In the context of the Flask Wiki repository, these features are implemented to provide a secure and controlled environment for users to interact with the application. The authentication and authorization system is designed to verify the identity of users and grant access to specific resources and routes based on their roles and permissions.

The importance of authentication and authorization cannot be overstated, as it helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and ensures that users can only perform actions that they are permitted to do. In the Flask Wiki application, authentication and authorization are implemented using a combination of user sessions, login and logout functionality, access control mechanisms, and error handling.

## Key Components / Concepts
The authentication and authorization system in Flask Wiki relies on several key components and concepts, including:

* **User sessions**: Flask uses sessions to store user data, such as the user ID, to keep track of authenticated users. The session is created when a user logs in and is stored on the server-side.
* **Login and logout functionality**: The application provides login and logout functionality to manage user sessions. The login function verifies the user's credentials and creates a new session if the credentials are valid, while the logout function destroys the session and logs the user out.
* **Access control**: The application implements access control mechanisms to restrict access to certain routes and resources based on user roles and permissions. This is done using decorators and other mechanisms to check if a user has the required permissions to access a particular resource.
* **Error handling**: The application includes error handling mechanisms to handle authentication and authorization errors, such as invalid login credentials or forbidden access. This ensures that the application can handle errors in a robust and secure manner.

## How it Works
The authentication and authorization process in Flask Wiki works as follows:

1. **User login**: A user attempts to log in to the application by providing their credentials, such as username and password. The application verifies the user's credentials and checks if they are valid.
2. **Authentication**: If the credentials are valid, the application creates a new user session and stores the user ID in the session. The session is then used to track the user's activity and authenticate subsequent requests.
3. **Authorization**: The application checks the user's role and permissions to determine what resources and routes they can access. This is done by checking the user's role and permissions against the access control mechanisms implemented in the application.
4. **Access control**: The application enforces access control mechanisms to restrict access to certain routes and resources based on the user's role and permissions. If a user attempts to access a resource that they are not permitted to access, the application will return an error message or redirect the user to a different page.

## Example(s)
For example, the `login` function in `tests/test_basic.py` simulates a user authentication by hard-coding the session's `user_id` to 1 and marking the Flask session as permanent:
```python
def login():
    flask.session["user_id"] = 1
    flask.session.permanent = True
    return ""
```
This function demonstrates how the application can create a new user session and store the user ID in the session. The `login` function is used in the tests to simulate a user login and test the authentication and authorization features of the application.

Another example is the `ContextConverter` class in `tests/test_converters.py`, which validates the request and session context. This class is used to ensure that the request and session context are valid and that the user is authenticated before allowing access to certain resources.

## Diagram(s)
The following Mermaid diagram illustrates the authentication and authorization process in Flask Wiki:
```mermaid

    A[User Login] -->|Credentials|> B[Authentication]
    B -->|Valid Credentials|> C[Create Session]
    C -->|User ID|> D[Store in Session]
    D -->|Session|> E[Authorization]
    E -->|Role and Permissions|> F[Access Control]
    F -->|Allowed Resources|> G[Access Granted]
    F -->|Forbidden Resources|> H[Access Denied]
```
This diagram shows the flow of the authentication and authorization process, from user login to access control. The diagram illustrates how the application verifies the user's credentials, creates a new session, and checks the user's role and permissions to determine what resources and routes they can access.
