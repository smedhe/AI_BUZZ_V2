# Template Engine
## Overview
The template engine is a crucial component of the Flask web framework, responsible for rendering templates with dynamic data. Flask uses the Jinja2 template engine, which provides a powerful and flexible way to generate HTML templates. In this section, we will delve into the details of the template engine, its key components, and how it works.

## Key Components / Concepts
The template engine consists of several key components, including:
* **Jinja2**: The templating engine used by Flask to render templates.
* **Template Loader**: Responsible for loading templates from various sources, such as files or databases.
* **Template Context**: The data passed to the template engine to render the template.
* **Template Filters**: Functions that can be applied to template variables to modify their output.

## How it Works
The template engine works by rendering templates with dynamic data. Here's a step-by-step overview of the process:
1. The template loader loads the template from a file or database.
2. The template context is passed to the template engine, which replaces placeholders in the template with actual data.
3. The template engine applies template filters to modify the output of template variables.
4. The rendered template is returned as a string, which is then sent to the client as an HTTP response.

## Example(s)
Here's an example of how to use the template engine in Flask:
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def index():
    return render_template("index.html", name="John Doe")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```
In this example, the `render_template` function is used to render the `index.html` template with the `name` variable set to "John Doe".
