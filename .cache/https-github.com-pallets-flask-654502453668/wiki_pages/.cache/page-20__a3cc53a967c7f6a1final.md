# Deploying Flask Applications
## Overview
Flask applications can be deployed using various WSGI servers and deployment tools, allowing developers to choose the best approach for their specific use case. This flexibility enables efficient and scalable deployment of Flask applications in different environments.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components involved in deploying Flask applications include:
- WSGI servers such as Gunicorn or uWSGI, which handle HTTP requests and interact with the Flask application
- Deployment tools like Docker or Kubernetes, which provide a scalable and manageable way to deploy and maintain Flask applications

## How it Works
To deploy a Flask application, you first need to create a WSGI entry point. This is typically done by creating an instance of the Flask class and defining routes for your application. The WSGI server then interacts with the Flask application, handling HTTP requests and sending responses back to the client.

## Example(s)
Here's an example of creating a simple Flask application:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"
```
This example demonstrates the basic structure of a Flask application, including the creation of a Flask instance and the definition of a route.

```
This diagram shows the basic flow of a Flask application being deployed using a WSGI server and a web server. The Flask application is the core component, and the WSGI server handles interactions with the web server and client.
