# Example Application
## Overview
The example application is a simple Flask web application that demonstrates the basic structure and functionality of a Flask app.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components of the example application include:
* A Flask application instance
* Routes for handling HTTP requests
* A simple "Hello, World!" example

## How it Works
The example application works by creating a Flask application instance and defining routes for handling HTTP requests. The routes are used to map URLs to specific functions that handle the requests.

## Example(s)
An example of a simple "Hello, World!" application is shown below:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

## Diagram(s)

    participant Client as "Client"
    participant Flask as "Flask App"
    participant Server as "Server"

    Client->>Flask: Send HTTP Request
    Flask->>Server: Handle Request
    Server->>Flask: Return Response
    Flask->>Client: Return Response to Client
```
