# Readthedocs Configuration
## Overview
The Readthedocs configuration is a crucial aspect of the Flask Wiki project, as it enables the automated building and hosting of the project's documentation. The configuration file, `.readthedocs.yaml`, provides Read the Docs with the necessary instructions to build the project's documentation. This file is located in the root directory of the project and is used to specify the build environment, tools, and commands required to build the documentation.

The Readthedocs configuration is essential for ensuring that the project's documentation is up-to-date and accurately reflects the current state of the project. By automating the build process, the Readthedocs configuration saves time and reduces the risk of human error. Additionally, the configuration file provides a clear and concise record of the build process, making it easier to troubleshoot issues and maintain the project's documentation.

## Key Components / Concepts
The `.readthedocs.yaml` file specifies the build environment, tools, and commands required to build the documentation. The key components of this file include:
* `version`: The version of the Read the Docs configuration format. This specifies the syntax and structure of the configuration file.
* `build`: The build environment and tools. This section specifies the operating system, programming language, and other tools required to build the documentation.
* `os`: The operating system used for building, which is set to Ubuntu 24.04. This ensures that the build process is consistent and reliable.
* `tools`: The tools required for building, which includes Python 3.13. This specifies the version of Python used to build the documentation.
* `commands`: The commands executed during the build process, which includes installing the `uv` package manager, making it the global version, and running `uv run` to invoke Sphinx. These commands are executed in sequence to build the documentation.

The `.readthedocs.yaml` file also supports other options, such as specifying the documentation format, setting environment variables, and customizing the build process. These options provide flexibility and allow the build process to be tailored to the specific needs of the project.

## How it Works
The Readthedocs configuration works by specifying the build environment and tools required to build the project's documentation. When the documentation is built, Read the Docs uses the specified environment and tools to execute the commands outlined in the `.readthedocs.yaml` file. This process involves:
1. Installing the `uv` package manager via `asdf`. This installs the `uv` package manager, which is used to manage dependencies and build the documentation.
2. Making `uv` the global version. This sets the `uv` package manager as the global version, ensuring that it is used for all builds.
3. Running `uv run` to invoke Sphinx, which builds the documentation in the `docs` folder as a `dirhtml` site. This command builds the documentation using Sphinx, which generates HTML files that can be hosted on Read the Docs.

The build process also involves other steps, such as installing dependencies, setting environment variables, and customizing the build process. These steps are specified in the `.readthedocs.yaml` file and are executed by Read the Docs during the build process.

## Example(s)
An example of a `.readthedocs.yaml` file is provided below:
```yml
version: 2
build:
  os: ubuntu-24.04
  tools:
    python: '3.13'
  commands:
    - asdf plugin add uv
    - asdf install uv latest
    - asdf global uv latest
    - uv run --group docs sphinx-build -W -b dirhtml docs $READTHEDOCS_OUTPUT/html
```
This example demonstrates how to specify the build environment, tools, and commands required to build the project's documentation. The `version` field specifies the version of the Read the Docs configuration format, while the `build` field specifies the build environment and tools. The `commands` field specifies the commands executed during the build process.

Another example of a `.readthedocs.yaml` file is provided below:
```yml
version: 2
build:
  os: ubuntu-24.04
  tools:
    python: '3.13'
  commands:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
    - sphinx-build -W -b dirhtml docs $READTHEDOCS_OUTPUT/html
```
This example demonstrates how to specify the build environment, tools, and commands required to build the project's documentation using pip and Sphinx.
