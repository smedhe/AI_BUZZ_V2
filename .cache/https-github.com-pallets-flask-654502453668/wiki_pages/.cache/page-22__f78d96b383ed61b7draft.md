# Flask Tutorial
## Overview
Flask is a lightweight WSGI-based Python web framework that lets developers quickly create web applications by defining routes and returning responses, without imposing a fixed project structure or mandatory dependencies. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications.

## Key Components / Concepts
The core components of a Flask application include:
* The Flask instance, which is the central object that represents the application
* Routes, which map URLs to specific functions that handle requests
* View functions, which handle requests and return responses
* Templates, which are used to render dynamic content

## How it Works
When a request is made to a Flask application, the following steps occur:
1. The request is received by the WSGI server
2. The WSGI server passes the request to the Flask instance
3. The Flask instance uses the route map to determine which view function to call
4. The view function is called with the request data as arguments
5. The view function returns a response, which is then sent back to the client

## Example(s)
Here is an example of a simple Flask application:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"
```
This application defines a single route, `/`, which maps to the `hello` view function. When a request is made to this route, the `hello` function is called and returns the string "Hello, World!".

    Flask->>View: Call view function
    View->>Flask: Return response
    Flask->>WSGI: Response
    WSGI->>Client: Response
```
This diagram shows the flow of a request through a Flask application.
