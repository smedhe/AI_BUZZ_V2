# Core Package Structure
## Overview
The core package structure of Flask is designed to be lightweight and flexible, making it easy to get started with building web applications. At its core, Flask is a microframework that provides a basic structure for building web applications, while allowing developers to choose their own tools and libraries. The package structure is organized in a way that makes it easy to navigate and understand, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

## Key Components / Concepts
The core package structure of Flask includes several key components and concepts, including:
* The `Flask` class, which is the core of the framework and provides the basic structure for building web applications.
* The `app` object, which is an instance of the `Flask` class and is used to configure and run the application.
* Blueprints, which are a way to organize and structure the application into smaller, reusable components.
* Routes, which are used to map URLs to specific functions or methods in the application.
* Templates, which are used to render dynamic content in the application.

## How it Works
The core package structure of Flask works by providing a basic structure for building web applications, while allowing developers to choose their own tools and libraries. The `Flask` class provides the core functionality of the framework, including support for routes, templates, and blueprints. The `app` object is used to configure and run the application, and is typically created by instantiating the `Flask` class.

When a request is made to the application, Flask uses the routes to determine which function or method to call, and then renders the corresponding template to generate the response. Blueprints are used to organize and structure the application into smaller, reusable components, making it easier to build and maintain complex applications.

## Example(s)
Here is an example of a simple Flask application:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```
This example creates a simple Flask application with a single route that returns the string "Hello, World!".

## Diagram(s)
```mermaid

    participant Client as "Client"
    participant Flask as "Flask"
    participant Route as "Route"
    participant Template as "Template"

    Client->>Flask: Request
    Flask->>Route: Determine route
    Route->>Flask: Call corresponding function
    Flask->>Template: Render template
    Template->>Flask: Generate response
    Flask->>Client: Return response
```
This diagram shows the basic flow of a request through a Flask application, from the client making the request to the application returning the response.
