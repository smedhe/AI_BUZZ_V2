# Flaskr Tutorial Overview
## Overview
The Flaskr tutorial is an example blog application that demonstrates the key features of the Flask web framework, including routing, database handling, authentication, and templates. This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of how to build a web application using Flask, covering the basics of routing, templating, and database interactions.

## Key Components / Concepts
The Flaskr tutorial consists of several key components, including:
* Routing: Flask provides a flexible routing system that allows developers to map URLs to specific application endpoints.
* Database handling: Flask supports a variety of databases, including SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL, and provides a range of tools and libraries for interacting with these databases.
* Authentication: Flask provides a range of tools and libraries for handling user authentication, including support for login and logout functionality, user registration, and password hashing.
* Templating: Flask provides support for a range of templating engines, including Jinja2, which allows developers to separate presentation logic from application logic.

## How it Works
The Flaskr tutorial works by providing a series of examples and exercises that demonstrate how to build a web application using Flask. The tutorial covers the basics of routing, templating, and database interactions, and provides a range of examples and exercises to help developers learn and practice these skills.

## Example(s)
One example of how the Flaskr tutorial demonstrates the key features of Flask is through the use of routes. In the `blog.py` file, for example, the following code defines a route for the blog index page:
```python
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')
```
This code defines a route for the root URL of the application, and returns an HTML template for the index page.

## Diagram(s)
```mermaid

```
This diagram shows the flow of a user request through the Flask application, from the initial request to the final response.
