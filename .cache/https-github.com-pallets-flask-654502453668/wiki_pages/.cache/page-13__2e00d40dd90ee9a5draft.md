# Configuration Management
## Overview
Configuration management is a crucial aspect of any web application, including those built with Flask. It involves loading, accessing, and overriding configuration values to customize the application's behavior. In Flask, this is achieved through the `Config` class, which provides a centralized location for storing and managing configuration data.

## Key Components / Concepts
The `Config` class is a subclass of `flask.Config` and is designed to handle configuration settings for a Flask application. It does not define any specific behaviors but relies on the inherited properties and methods from `flask.Config`. The key components of configuration management in Flask include:

* **Configuration files**: Flask supports loading configuration from various file formats, such as Python files, JSON files, and TOML files.
* **Environment variables**: Configuration values can be loaded from environment variables, allowing for easy switching between different environments.
* **Configuration objects**: Configuration values can be loaded from objects, such as dictionaries or custom configuration classes.

## How it Works
The configuration management process in Flask involves the following steps:

1. **Creating a Config instance**: A `Config` instance is created, either directly or indirectly, when a Flask application is instantiated.
2. **Loading configuration values**: Configuration values are loaded from various sources, such as files, environment variables, or objects.
3. **Overriding configuration values**: Configuration values can be overridden using various methods, such as the `from_object` method or the `from_envvar` method.
4. **Accessing configuration values**: Configuration values can be accessed using the `config` attribute of the Flask application instance.

## Example(s)
Here is an example of loading configuration values from a Python file:
```python
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_pyfile('config.py')
```
And here is an example of loading configuration values from an environment variable:
```python
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_envvar('CONFIG_FILE')
```
