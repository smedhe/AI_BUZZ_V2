# JavaScript Example
## Overview
The JavaScript example provided in the repository is a basic demonstration of how to integrate JavaScript with a Flask web application. This example is crucial for understanding how to handle client-side scripting in a Flask project. The example consists of a simple Flask application that serves a JavaScript file, which in turn interacts with the Flask backend to perform certain actions.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components of this example include:
- A Flask application that serves a JavaScript file
- A JavaScript file that interacts with the Flask backend
- Routes defined in the Flask application to handle requests from the JavaScript file
- Template rendering to display the results of the JavaScript-Flask interaction

The main concepts involved in this example are:
- Client-side scripting using JavaScript
- Server-side rendering using Flask
- Interaction between client-side and server-side code

## How it Works
The JavaScript example works as follows:
1. The Flask application serves a JavaScript file to the client.
2. The JavaScript file makes requests to the Flask backend to perform certain actions.
3. The Flask backend processes the requests and returns the results to the JavaScript file.
4. The JavaScript file updates the client-side display based on the results received from the Flask backend.

## Example(s)
For example, consider a simple JavaScript file that makes a request to the Flask backend to retrieve some data. The Flask backend processes the request, retrieves the data, and returns it to the JavaScript file. The JavaScript file then updates the client-side display to show the retrieved data.
