# Introduction to Flask
Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications.

## Overview
Flask offers suggestions, but doesn't enforce any dependencies or project layout. It is up to the developer to choose the tools and libraries they want to use. There are many extensions provided by the community that make adding new functionality easy. The framework's flexibility is reflected in its file structure, with key files such as [README.md](README.md) and [tests/test_apps/cliapp/app.py](tests/test_apps/cliapp/app.py) demonstrating its usage.

## Key Components / Concepts
The key components of Flask include the application instance, routes, and templates. The application instance is the core of the Flask application, and is used to configure the application and define routes. Routes are used to map URLs to specific functions in the application, and templates are used to render dynamic content. For example, the [tests/test_apps/cliapp/inner1/__init__.py](tests/test_apps/cliapp/inner1/__init__.py) file shows how to initialize a Flask application.

## How it Works
Flask works by creating a new instance of the Flask class, passing the current module name as an argument. This instance is then used to configure the application and define routes. When a request is made to the application, Flask uses the routes to determine which function to call, and then renders the response using templates. The [tests/test_apps/cliapp/inner1/inner2/flask.py](tests/test_apps/cliapp/inner1/inner2/flask.py) file provides an example of how to define routes and render templates.

## Example(s)
A simple example of a Flask application is:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"
```
This application defines a single route, "/", which returns the string "Hello, World!".

    participant Client as "Client"
    participant Flask as "Flask"
    participant Route as "Route"
    participant Template as "Template"

    Client->>Flask: Request
    Flask->>Route: Determine Route
    Route->>Flask: Call Function
    Flask->>Template: Render Response
    Template->>Client: Return Response
```
This flowchart shows the basic flow of a Flask application, from the client making a request to the application returning a response.
